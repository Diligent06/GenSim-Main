{'task-name': 'precision-pallet-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack a specific sequence of differently colored cylinders onto a pallet, ensuring each cylinder is precisely aligned with the one below it without any overhang.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-tower-balancing' and 'cylinder-sort-stand', but it introduces a unique challenge of precision stacking with an emphasis on alignment and sequence, which are not covered in the current tasks. The simulation code correctly implements the task setup and language descriptions, with unique target poses and language goals for each cylinder.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
