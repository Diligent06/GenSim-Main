However, the task 'cylinder_zone_classification' is very similar in concept, with the primary difference being the use of zones instead of lines for sorting. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and matches the language descriptions, but the task itself might not be sufficiently novel or interesting to warrant addition to the task list given the existing similar tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
