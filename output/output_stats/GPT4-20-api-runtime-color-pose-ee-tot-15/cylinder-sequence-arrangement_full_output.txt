================= Task and Asset Design!

>>> Prompt: 
You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 

=========
Here are all the assets. Use only these assets in the task and code design.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}
- place-red-in-green: {'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the red blocks and place them into the green bowls amidst other objects.', 'task-name': 'place-red-in-green'}
- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}
- stack-block-pyramid: {'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'sequentially stack 6 blocks into a pyramid of 3-2-1 with rainbow colored ordering.', 'task-name': 'stack-block-pyramid'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.

=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines provided, here is a new task designed to be unique and challenging within the provided constraints:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-tower-balance",
    "task-description": "Sequentially stack different colored cylinders to form a vertical tower, ensuring that each cylinder is completely balanced on the previous one without any part hanging off.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

This task, "cylinder-tower-balance," involves precision, balance, and an understanding of the center of mass of the objects involved. The novelty in this task lies in the requirement to balance the cylinders directly on top of each other, which is different from stacking blocks or boxes that typically have larger, flatter surfaces. This task also focuses on the vertical dimension and the careful manipulation skills needed to achieve a stable and balanced tower.

The challenge comes from the cylindrical shape, which is harder to stack than blocks due to the curved surface. The task will test the robot's capability to align the cylinders directly over the center of the previous one to maintain balance. Furthermore, the cylindrical shapes must be colored distinctly to add visual complexity to the task, requiring color recognition and differentiation as a part of the stack sequencing.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, primitive actions, camera configurations, and workspace bounds.
- **Reset**: Prepares the task for a new episode.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly for demonstration or testing purposes.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state of the task and the goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Provides additional utility functions such as filling templates with data and generating random sizes or colors for objects.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
`self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, each defined by a translation vector `[x, y, z]` and a rotation quaternion `[q0, q1, q2, q3]`.
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can be matched to any target (`True`) or if they must be matched uniquely (`False`).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational component.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, which can be either pose matching or zone coverage.
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A string providing a low-level language instruction describing the goal of the current step.

Understanding these components is crucial for implementing the "cylinder-tower-balance" task, as they provide the mechanisms to define the task's goals, evaluate progress, and interact with the simulation environment.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-tower-balance".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where the robot must stack cylinders on top of each other to form a balanced tower. The `CylinderTowerBalance` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment by adding differently colored cylinders and defining their target poses for stacking. The `Suction` end-effector is used to lift the cylinders along the Z-axis. The `add_goal` method is called for each cylinder to specify the desired end state, and the `pick_place` primitive action is set for the robot to execute.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.

=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
After considering the constraints and reviewing the provided examples, here are three new task ideas:

1. Cylinder Sequence Arrangement:
```python
{
  "task-name": "cylinder-sequence-arrangement",
  "task-description": "Arrange a sequence of differently colored cylinders by height in ascending order on a designated stand.",
  "assets-used": ["stacking/stand.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task is novel compared to the provided examples because it primarily focuses on arranging objects by their height rather than color, shape, or fitting into fixtures. The challenge involves identifying the relative heights of the cylinders and precisely placing them in order.

2. Ball Sorting by Size:
```python
{
  "task-name": "ball-sorting-by-size",
  "task-description": "Sort balls of varying sizes into separate zones on the tabletop, with each zone designated for a specific size.",
  "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task introduces the challenge of sorting objects by size rather than color or placement into containers. The difficulty lies in the perception and manipulation required to differentiate between the sizes and place them accurately.

3. Pyramid Construction with Cylinders:
```python
{
  "task-name": "pyramid-construction-cylinders",
  "task-description": "Construct a pyramid by stacking cylinders of decreasing sizes on top of one another, ensuring the stability of the structure.",
  "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: Unlike stacking blocks, cylinders present a unique challenge due to their rounded shape, which requires more precise control for balance. The task complexity is heightened when ensuring the stability of a pyramid structure.

After evaluating the novelty and challenges of each task, the most different task from the ones generated before is the "Cylinder Sequence Arrangement." Here's why:

- Unlike previous tasks that focus on color or simply stacking, this task requires the robot to discern and manipulate objects based on height, which introduces a new dimension to the sorting criteria.
- It involves a fine-grained manipulation challenge, as cylinders do not stack as easily as blocks, and the robot needs to balance them on a stand, increasing the precision required.
- The task still maintains a level of complexity that is feasible within the physics simulation and the capabilities of tabletop manipulation.

Therefore, the selected task is:

```python
{
  "task-name": "cylinder-sequence-arrangement",
  "task-description": "Arrange a sequence of differently colored cylinders by height in ascending order on a designated stand.",
  "assets-used": ["stacking/stand.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
Yes, I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (train), six degrees of freedom (False), and other task-related settings. The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task environment, and the `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly for demonstration purposes.

The `reward` method calculates the delta reward for the current timestep based on the current goal step, which involves matching object poses or measuring object intersection with a zone. The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, considering object symmetries. The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file and replace key strings with specified values. The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds, and the `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether each object can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating whether the goal is to match poses (`pose`) or to place objects within a zone (`zone`).
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is `zone`, including the target and size of the zone.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses, dependent on the number of goals rather than the number of objects.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "cylinder-sequence-arrangement" task, as they provide the necessary methods and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-sequence-arrangement".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "cylinder-sequence-arrangement" in python code block starting with ```python.

# Instantiate the task

```

In this code, we define a task to arrange cylinders by height in ascending order on a stand. We use the Suction end-effector because we need to move objects on the Z axis. We define the colors and heights for the cylinders, add a stand to the environment, and then add cylinders with random colors and heights. We sort the cylinders by height to determine the target poses and add goals for each cylinder to be placed in the correct order on the stand. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1/5` because we have five cylinders to arrange, and each correct placement contributes equally to the task's completion.
