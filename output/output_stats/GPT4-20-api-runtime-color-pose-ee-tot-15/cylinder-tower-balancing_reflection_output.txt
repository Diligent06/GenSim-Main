{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-balancing', 'task-description': 'Stack and balance a tower of three differently colored cylinders on top of each other on a single green line without the tower toppling over.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'line/single-green-line-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the other tasks listed, as it requires precise stacking and balancing along a narrow line, which introduces an element of stability not explicitly present in the other tasks. The language descriptions are clear and directly map to the actions required to complete the task. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal of the task by defining the target poses for the cylinders and adding language goals for each step of the stacking process. However, the code assumes that the cylinders do not need to consider rotation around the vertical axis. If the simulation environment treats the cylinders as having rotational symmetry, this is acceptable. Otherwise, the code should account for the rotational alignment of the cylinders to ensure the task is well-defined.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
