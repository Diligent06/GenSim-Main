{'task-name': 'stack-blocks-around-bowl', 'task-description': 'Stack four different colored blocks around a bowl without placing any block inside the bowl or knocking it over.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/block.urdf', 'bowl/bowl.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the other tasks listed, as it involves spatial reasoning about the objects' positions relative to the bowl, without stacking them on top of each other or sorting them into zones or kits. It also combines precision placement with the challenge of avoiding disturbing the central bowl, which adds to its complexity. The language descriptions are clear and correspond to the task goals.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
