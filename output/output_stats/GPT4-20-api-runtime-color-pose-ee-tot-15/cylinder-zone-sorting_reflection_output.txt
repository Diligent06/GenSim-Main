{'task-name': 'cylinder-zone-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort colored cylinders into matching colored zones on the tabletop, ensuring precise placement within the boundaries.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-sort-stand' which involves sorting cylinders by color onto a stand. However, 'cylinder-zone-sorting' focuses on precise placement within flat zones rather than stands, which could offer a different challenge in terms of perception and control. Despite this, the task may not be sufficiently distinct or add significant value to the existing suite of tasks, as it shares similarities with 'cylinder-sort-stand' and 'precision-pallet-stacking'. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and language descriptions in the task, but the task itself may not be unique enough to warrant addition.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
