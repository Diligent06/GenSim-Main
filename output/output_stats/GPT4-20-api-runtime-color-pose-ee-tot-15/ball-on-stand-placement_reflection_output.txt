{'task-name': 'ball-on-stand-placement', 'task-description': 'Place a series of colored balls onto their corresponding colored stands, ensuring that each ball rests securely on top without falling off.', 'assets-used': ['ball/ball-template.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the others in the current task list, as it focuses on precise placement of spherical objects onto stands rather than stacking, aligning, or sorting. It introduces a different challenge of balancing a ball on a stand, which is not covered by other tasks. Furthermore, the simulation code aligns with the goal and language descriptions provided in the task, offering clear objectives and outcomes.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
