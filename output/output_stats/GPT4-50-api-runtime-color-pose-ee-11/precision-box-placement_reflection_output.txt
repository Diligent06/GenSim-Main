{'task-name': 'precision-box-placement', 'task-description': 'Place a set of three boxes of increasing sizes precisely within three correspondingly sized zones marked on the tabletop, with the smallest zone being the most challenging due to its limited margin for error.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'box/box-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'color-coded-cylinder-sorting' and 'descending-diameter-cylinder-place' as it involves precise placement of boxes rather than cylinders and requires matching the sizes as well as the colors. The progressive increase in difficulty with smaller zones adds an interesting challenge. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, with each box having a corresponding zone and language descriptions that match the task objectives. However, the existing task 'align-box-corner' also involves precision placement of a box, which could make the proposed task less novel.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
