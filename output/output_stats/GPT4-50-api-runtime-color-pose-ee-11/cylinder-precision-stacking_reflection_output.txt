{'task-name': 'cylinder-precision-stacking', 'task-description': 'Sequentially place three colored cylinders of decreasing diameters on top of each other, forming a tapered stack on a designated area of the pallet.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks in the list, as it focuses on precision stacking of objects with varying sizes, which is not covered by the other stacking tasks. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, with appropriate language descriptions for each step, which enhances the task's complexity and educational value. Furthermore, the task introduces an element of precision in both placement and size differentiation, which could be beneficial for training manipulation algorithms. However, it is important to ensure that the language descriptions are clear and unambiguous, and that the simulation code is robust and free of errors.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
