{'task-name': 'cylinder-coordinate-assembly', 'task-description': 'Assemble a structure by placing three different-colored cylinders (red, green, blue) onto the corresponding colored corners of a zone, ensuring that each cylinder is standing upright without tilting.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'color-coded-cylinder-sorting', 'cylinder-precision-stacking', and 'descending-diameter-cylinder-place' as it involves placing cylinders onto corresponding colored corners rather than sorting or stacking. It also introduces an additional element of spatial reasoning by requiring the cylinders to be placed on specific corners, which is not covered by the current tasks. Furthermore, the simulation code appears to correctly implement the task requirements and language descriptions, providing clear objectives and goals that match the task description.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
