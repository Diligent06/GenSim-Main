{'task-name': 'cylinder-height-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort a set of five cylinders of varying heights into ascending order on a line marked on the tabletop, ensuring the tallest cylinder is placed at one marked end and the shortest at the opposite end.', 'assets-used': ['line/single-green-line-template.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from existing tasks such as 'color-gradient-tower' and 'height_sorted_block_tower' as it focuses on sorting by height rather than color or stacking. The task also combines spatial reasoning with the physical property of height, which is not covered by other tasks. Moreover, the simulation code appears to successfully achieve the goal and language descriptions in the task, providing clear instructions for each step in sorting the cylinders.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
