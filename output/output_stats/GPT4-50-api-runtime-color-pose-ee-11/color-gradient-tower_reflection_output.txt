{'task-name': 'color-gradient-tower', 'task-description': 'Build a color-gradient tower by stacking five uniquely colored cylinders, ranging from dark to light shades, in ascending order of brightness on a designated zone, ensuring stability and color sequence accuracy.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the current tasks, as it requires both color recognition and precision stacking in a specific order based on the gradient, which is not covered by any other task. However, the task 'cylinder_color_sort' and 'color_coded_cylinder_sorting' involve color sorting of cylinders, and 'cylinder-precision-stacking' involves stacking cylinders. The new task combines elements from these but adds the unique challenge of arranging objects by color brightness, which could be interesting for developing more advanced perception and planning algorithms.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
