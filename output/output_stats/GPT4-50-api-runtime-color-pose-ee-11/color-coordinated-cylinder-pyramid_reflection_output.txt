{'task-name': 'color-coordinated-cylinder-pyramid', 'task-description': 'Stack a pyramid of three differently colored cylinders on a designated zone by placing them in an order with the largest and darkest-colored cylinder at the base, the medium and medium-shade cylinder in the middle, and the smallest and lightest-colored cylinder on top, ensuring the stack remains stable within the zone.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-precision-stacking' and 'color-gradient-tower' which involve stacking cylinders in a specific order based on size or color. However, this task combines both elements (color and size) to create a more complex sorting and stacking challenge, which could be beneficial for training robots in tasks that require a higher level of dexterity and decision-making. The language descriptions accurately reflect the goals of the task, and the simulation code appears to achieve the goal of stacking the cylinders in the correct order, although it assumes the existence of certain methods and objects such as 'get_random_pose' or 'fill_template', which are not provided in the snippet.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
