However, the task description in the current implementation does not match the provided task description, which specifies a color sequence. The implementation sorts the blocks by height but does not enforce a specific color order. Additionally, the language descriptions in the code do not reflect the sequence requirement, only the color of the individual blocks to be stacked. To align with the task description, the implementation should be adjusted to enforce the color sequence and update the language descriptions accordingly.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
