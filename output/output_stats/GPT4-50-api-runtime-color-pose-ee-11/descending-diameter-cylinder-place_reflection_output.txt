{'task-name': 'descending-diameter-cylinder-place', 'task-description': "Arrange a set of four colored cylinders on a fixture, ordered by decreasing diameter from left to right, with each cylinder's color corresponding to a marked zone on the fixture.", 'assets-used': ['insertion/fixture.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-precision-stacking' and 'color-coded-cylinder-sorting' in terms of sorting and placing cylinders by color and size. However, this task uniquely combines the precision placement of cylinders in a specific size order with color matching, which is not covered by any single task in the current list. It also introduces a spatial component of left-to-right ordering that is not explicitly mentioned in other tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
