{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-precision-placement', 'task-description': "Create a tower by stacking three cylinders with different diameters on top of each other in the center of an upright-standing fixture, ensuring that each cylinder aligns perfectly within the fixture's boundaries.", 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'insertion/fixture.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-precision-stacking' and 'descending-diameter-cylinder-place' but adds the unique challenge of aligning cylinders within a fixture's boundaries, which could enhance precision placement skills. However, the task may not be sufficiently differentiated from existing tasks to warrant addition.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
