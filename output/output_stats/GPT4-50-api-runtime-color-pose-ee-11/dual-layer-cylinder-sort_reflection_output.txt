{'task-name': 'dual-layer-cylinder-sort', 'task-description': 'Sort a set of colored cylinders by placing them on two distinct pallet layers, organizing them by color, with a maximum of two cylinders per pallet slot.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks and introduces a new challenge of sorting objects on different vertical layers, which is not covered by any current task. Moreover, the simulation code aligns well with the language descriptions and goals of the task, providing clear objectives and a finite number of steps to achieve the sorting.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
