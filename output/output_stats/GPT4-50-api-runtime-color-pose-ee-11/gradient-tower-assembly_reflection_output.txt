{'task-name': 'gradient-tower-assembly', 'task-description': 'Assemble a tower by stacking five different colored blocks from the base upwards, with each subsequent block having a lighter color shade to create a gradient effect, ensuring that the lightest block is at the top.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/block.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'color-gradient-tower' as it uses blocks instead of cylinders, requires precise stacking on a base rather than a zone, and includes specific language goals for each step. However, the task concept is similar to 'color-gradient-tower', and the added complexity may not be enough to justify a new task. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task objectives and language descriptions, but the uniqueness of the task compared to existing ones is marginal.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
