{'task-name': 'tiered-block-ascent', 'task-description': 'Arrange a series of three differently-sized rectangular blocks, each a unique color, into a vertical ascending staircase formation on a designated standing zone, with the smallest block on top and the largest at the bottom, matching each block with a correspondingly colored outline on the zone.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/block.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the current tasks as it involves arranging blocks in a specific ascending order based on size, which is not covered by the current list. Moreover, the simulation code aligns with the task's goal and provides clear language descriptions for each step of the task. The task also introduces a new challenge of vertical stacking in a constrained space, which is different from the horizontal sorting or placement tasks currently available.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
