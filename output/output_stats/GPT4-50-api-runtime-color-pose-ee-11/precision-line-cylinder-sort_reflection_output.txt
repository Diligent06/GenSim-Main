However, the simulation code provided does not fully match the task description. The code suggests that all zones will have a 'single-green-line' pattern, which does not align with the task description of having unique patterns for different sizes. Furthermore, the language descriptions are not sufficiently varied to match the unique patterns (single, double, triple) as described in the task reset method. To ensure the task is both interesting and accurately represented, the simulation code and language descriptions need to be corrected to reflect the intended complexity of sorting cylinders by line patterns.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
