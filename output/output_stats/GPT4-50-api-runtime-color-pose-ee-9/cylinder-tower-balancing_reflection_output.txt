{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-balancing', 'task-description': 'Construct a balanced tower using three differently sized cylinders by stacking them on top of each other from largest at the bottom to smallest at the top on a single stand without toppling over.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf'], 'reasons': "the task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks as it specifically focuses on balancing objects of different sizes in a single tower formation, which introduces unique challenges in stability and precision. Additionally, the language descriptions accurately reflect the goals and steps of the task, and the simulation code appears to be designed to achieve these goals. The task is also distinct from 'cylinder-hurdle-arrangement' and 'color-coded-pallet-organization' as it involves precise stacking for balance rather than arrangement or organization based on color or size.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
