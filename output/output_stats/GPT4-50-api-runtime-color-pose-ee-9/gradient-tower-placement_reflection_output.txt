{'task-name': 'gradient-tower-placement', 'task-description': 'Build two separate towers each made of three differently colored cylinders, placing them on a patterned zone marked with two distinct areas, one for each tower, while ensuring that the cylinders in each tower are arranged in a color gradient sequence from the lightest on top to the darkest at the base.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'color-gradient-tower' which also involves creating a gradient with cylinders. However, 'gradient-tower-placement' introduces the additional complexity of building two separate towers, each in a designated zone, which could make it sufficiently distinct and interesting. The task also seems to meet the language description goals and the simulation code appears to achieve the task objectives. Yet, the language goals in the code have a minor issue as they do not correctly reflect the number of cylinders for the second tower's language goal.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
