{'task-name': 'colored-block-pathway', 'task-description': 'Create an unbroken pathway from a start zone to a target bowl using a sequence of differently colored blocks, ensuring each block is touching the next.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from existing tasks, as it combines elements of precise placement, sequence following, and spatial reasoning in a unique way that is not covered by the current tasks. It requires the robot to not only identify and manipulate objects based on color but also to place them in a specific order to create a continuous path, which adds complexity and educational value. Moreover, the simulation code appears to align with the task's goals and language descriptions, providing clear objectives and a coherent structure for the task.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
