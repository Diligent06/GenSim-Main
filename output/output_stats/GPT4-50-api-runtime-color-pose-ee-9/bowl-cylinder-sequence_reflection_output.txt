{'task-name': 'bowl-cylinder-sequence', 'task-description': 'Place a series of different colored cylinders into corresponding colored bowls arranged in a line, ensuring that the sequence of cylinder colors matches the sequence of bowl colors from left to right.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the other tasks listed, as it combines color matching with sequence arrangement in a line, which is not covered by any of the current tasks. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and matches the language descriptions in the task by assigning the correct color to each cylinder and bowl, creating goals for each cylinder, and generating language goals that describe the required action. However, the task may benefit from a more complex arrangement or additional constraints to increase difficulty and uniqueness.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
