However, it does not introduce a significantly new challenge or learning opportunity that is not already covered by the existing tasks. The simulation code provided correctly implements the task with appropriate language descriptions for each action, but the task itself does not add enough novelty to the current task list.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
