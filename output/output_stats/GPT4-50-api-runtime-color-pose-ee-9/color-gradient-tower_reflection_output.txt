{'task-name': 'color-gradient-tower', 'task-description': 'Build a tower using six differently colored cylinders by stacking them onto a stand in an order that creates a color gradient from darkest to lightest, while avoiding placement inside marked no-go zones.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks, as it combines elements of color recognition, precise stacking, and spatial awareness to avoid no-go zones. It is similar to 'cylinder-tower-balancing' but adds complexity with the color gradient requirement and no-go zones. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, including the generation of language descriptions for each step, which can be useful for language-conditioned learning algorithms.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
