{'task-name': 'precision-box-placement', 'task-description': "Pick up a small blue box and place it precisely within the bounds of a marked white zone on a pallet, ensuring the box does not touch the zone's edges.", 'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the tasks in the current list, as it emphasizes precision placement within a confined space without touching the edges, which is a unique challenge not covered by the other tasks. However, it is similar to 'color-coded-pallet-organization' in terms of placing objects in designated zones. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and aligns with the language descriptions, but to avoid redundancy with 'color-coded-pallet-organization', the task could be modified to increase complexity or introduce novel elements.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
