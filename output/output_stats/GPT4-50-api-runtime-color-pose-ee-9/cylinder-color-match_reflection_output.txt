{'task-name': 'cylinder-color-match', 'task-description': 'Pick up five differently colored cylinders and place them standing upright into correspondingly colored circles on a zone mat, without knocking over adjacent cylinders.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'color-coded-pallet-organization' and 'precision_block_sorting', which involve placing objects in matching colored zones. However, the 'cylinder-color-match' task introduces an additional challenge of placing the cylinders upright and avoiding knocking over adjacent cylinders, which adds a new dimension of difficulty and precision. The language descriptions are clear and match the goals of the task.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
