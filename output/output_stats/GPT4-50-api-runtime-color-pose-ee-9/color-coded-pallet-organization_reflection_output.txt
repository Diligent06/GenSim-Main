{'task-name': 'color-coded-pallet-organization', 'task-description': 'Arrange a series of colored cylinders on a pallet by matching the cylinder colors to the designated colored zones on the pallet, ensuring that each cylinder is placed within the boundaries of its corresponding zone.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'palletizing-boxes' and 'cylinder-hurdle-arrangement' as it combines color matching with spatial organization on a pallet. It also includes language goals that align with the task actions, which can be beneficial for language-conditioned learning. The simulation code appears to correctly set up the environment and goals for the task, including the language descriptions. However, the task may need to be adjusted for complexity and variability to ensure it provides a meaningful challenge in the context of the existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
