{'task-name': 'precision-block-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort a set of five colored blocks into matching colored zones on a pallet, each requiring precise placement to fit within a designated outline without overlapping with adjacent zones.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is too similar to 'palette_arrangement_challenge' which already involves placing colored blocks on a pallet in designated zones. Additionally, 'color-coded-pallet-organization' involves arranging colored items on a pallet, and 'precision_box_placement' covers the aspect of precise placement within bounds. Therefore, the proposed task does not add sufficient novelty or complexity to justify its addition.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
