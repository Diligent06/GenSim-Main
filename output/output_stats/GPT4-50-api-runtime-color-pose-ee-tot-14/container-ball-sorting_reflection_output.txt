{'task-name': 'container-ball-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort a set of five differently colored balls into individual containers based on their color, ensuring that each ball is placed without bouncing out.', 'assets-used': ['container/container-template.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is somewhat similar to 'ball-pyramid-precision-placement' and 'containerized-cylinder-storage', but it introduces a new element of sorting without the constraint of stacking or careful placement within a single container. It emphasizes sorting and precision in placing the balls into separate containers. However, the task may not be sufficiently complex or unique compared to existing tasks, and it lacks a clear mechanism to prevent balls from bouncing out, which is part of the task description.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
