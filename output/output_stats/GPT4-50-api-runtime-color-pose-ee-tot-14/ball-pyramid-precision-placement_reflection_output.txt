{'task-name': 'ball-pyramid-precision-placement', 'task-description': 'Arrange five differently colored balls into a pyramid formation atop a stand, with each ball resting in a small concave fixture designed to hold it in place.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task introduces a novel challenge of precision placement in a pyramid structure, which is not covered by the current tasks. It requires spatial reasoning and precise control, especially since the balls must be placed within concave fixtures. This adds a layer of complexity compared to flat surface placements. The task description and the simulation code are well-aligned with clear language goals that match the task's objectives. The task also uses a different end-effector (Suction) which can diversify the skills required for task completion.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
