{'task-name': 'multi-level-cylinder-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange five differently colored cylinders on multilevel stands ensuring each cylinder is placed on a stand with a matching color indicator.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'bi-level-block-organization' as it introduces multilevel stands and requires precise placement on different heights, which can add complexity and depth to the task. The existing 'color-coded-cylinder-placement' task involves arranging cylinders in a row on a flat surface, whereas this task requires vertical placement with height considerations. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and provides language descriptions for the task, which aligns with the requirements for a new task. However, the z-coordinate calculation for the stands in the reset function seems to be incorrect as it does not account for the height of the stands themselves, which would result in all stands being placed at the same level.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
