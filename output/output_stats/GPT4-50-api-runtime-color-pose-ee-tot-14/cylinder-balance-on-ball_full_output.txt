================= Task and Asset Design!

>>> Prompt: 
You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 

=========
Here are all the assets. Use only these assets in the task and code design.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}
- place-red-in-green: {'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the red blocks and place them into the green bowls amidst other objects.', 'task-name': 'place-red-in-green'}
- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}
- stack-block-pyramid: {'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'sequentially stack 6 blocks into a pyramid of 3-2-1 with rainbow colored ordering.', 'task-name': 'stack-block-pyramid'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-tower",
 "task-description": "Stack a tower with alternating colors of five cylinders on top of a flat box, ensuring each cylinder is centered on the one below.",
 "assets-used": [
     "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf",
     "box/box-template.urdf"
 ]
}
```
Reason: This task involves precision stacking of cylindrical objects which presents a different challenge compared to stacking blocks or placing objects in bowls. It also requires color differentiation and alignment skills.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-transfer",
 "task-description": "Transfer a set of five colored balls from one bowl to another using a cylinder as a scoop, without dropping any balls.",
 "assets-used": [
     "ball/ball-template.urdf",
     "bowl/bowl.urdf",
     "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"
 ]
}
```
Reason: This task involves using a cylindrical object in a novel way as a tool to move other objects (balls) between containers. It challenges the robot's ability to manipulate objects with an improvised tool.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "pallete-precision-placement",
 "task-description": "Arrange five different colored boxes in a specific sequence on a pallet, according to a predefined pattern.",
 "assets-used": [
     "box/box-template.urdf",
     "pallet/pallet.urdf"
 ]
}
```
Reason: This task emphasizes pattern recognition and sequence execution, where the robot needs to identify colors and place boxes in a precise arrangement.

Chosen Task: **Task 1**

Reason for Choice: Task 1 ("cylinder-tower") is the most different from previous tasks as it introduces a new shape (cylinders) for stacking, which is not covered by the prior examples. Stacking cylinders requires a different approach to stability and alignment compared to blocks due to their curved surfaces, and the task also includes a color differentiation component. This task will test the robot's precision and balance in manipulation, as well as its ability to handle objects with more complex geometries.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, a pick-and-place primitive, and camera configurations. It also sets thresholds for position and rotation evaluation, workspace bounds, and initializes variables for goals, language goals, progress, rewards, and asset root directory.

The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment, clearing goals and progress.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions for the robot to perform the task perfectly. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the next best action.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses either pose matching or zone intersection to evaluate the task's progress.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, based on whether all goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal, which is a textual description of the task's current goal.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file and replace key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-tower" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way.

Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines the `CylinderTower` task, which involves stacking cylinders of different colors on top of a flat box. The task uses the `Suction` end-effector to move the cylinders vertically and place them on top of each other. The `reset` method adds a base box and five cylinders to the environment, each with a unique color. The cylinders are to be stacked in a random order, with the goal of each cylinder being to be placed on top of the previous one, centered and upright. The `add_goal` method is used to define the motion and language goals for each cylinder, with the `step_max_reward` being divided equally among the number of cylinders to stack. The `primitive` is set to `push`, which is a requirement of the task API, even though the actual end-effector used is `Suction`.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "color-coded-cylinder-placement",
 "task-description": "Arrange five uniquely colored cylinders in a row on the table, matching each to a correspondingly colored zone marker.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task involves recognizing different colors and placing objects with precision. The task is novel because it combines the challenge of color matching with spatial arrangement, which has not been emphasized in previous tasks.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "balanced-bowl-stacking",
 "task-description": "Stack three bowls of different colors on top of each other without toppling, with the smallest bowl on top.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
The novelty here lies in the challenge of delicately balancing objects with a curved base, which is a distinct manipulation task that requires fine motor control and stability assessment.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "precise-ball-placement",
 "task-description": "Place five balls of different colors into five separate, small zones with matching color boundaries without any balls touching the zone edges.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task is unique because it requires precision in placing spherical objects into constrained spaces, which is different from stacking or insertion tasks. The challenge is heightened by the need to avoid contact with the zone boundaries.

**Chosen Task**: Task 3

The chosen task, "precise-ball-placement," stands out as it requires high precision and control to place balls within small, colored boundaries without touching the edges, which differs from tasks that involve stacking, sweeping, or aligning objects. It also incorporates color recognition in a new context of spatial constraints, adding to its uniqueness and challenge.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: A base class for tasks that includes initialization of the environment, reward function, task completion metrics, and helper functions.
- `reset`: Resets the task to its initial state.
- `oracle`: Provides an oracle agent that can calculate the perfect action based on the current state of the environment.
- `reward`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- `done`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.
- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal`: Returns the current language goal if available, otherwise returns a default task completion description.
- `get_reward`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template`: Fills a URDF template with specified values and returns the path to the temporary file.
- `get_random_size`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown`: Colors an object with a random shade of brown.
- `add_object`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each defined by a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with any target (True) or if they must match with a unique target (False).
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the subgoal, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: Additional parameters for the subgoal, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions for the subgoal.

The task "color-coded-cylinder-placement" will require creating a simulation environment where cylinders are placed according to color-coded zones. The task will involve using the APIs to initialize the environment, add objects, define goals, and calculate rewards based on the successful placement of cylinders in their corresponding zones. The task will also need to ensure that the objects obey physics and do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds above the table.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-cylinder-placement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where five uniquely colored cylinders must be placed into correspondingly colored zones. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick and place the cylinders. The task is reset by adding cylinders and zones to the environment, shuffling the colors each time to ensure variability. Goals are added for each cylinder to be placed in the correct zone, with a full reward given for correct placement. The language goal provides a description of the task for each cylinder.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and assets provided, I have generated three different tasks that offer unique challenges and strategic requirements. Here is a brief description of each task:

Task 1:
- **Task Name**: "precision-pallet-cylinder-stack"
- **Task Description**: "Stack a specific number of uniquely colored cylinders onto a single marked area of a pallet, ensuring each is placed without knocking over existing cylinders."
- **Assets Used**: ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task involves precise manipulation to stack cylinders (which are more prone to rolling and misalignment compared to boxes) onto a pallet. It requires careful placement to maintain the stability of the stack. The use of multiple colors adds an element of color recognition and sorting into the task.

Task 2:
- **Task Name**: "sort-and-stack-mixed-shapes"
- **Task Description**: "Sort and stack a mixed set of shapes including blocks, balls, and cylinders by color onto corresponding colored zones marked on the tabletop."
- **Assets Used**: ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task combines sorting with stacking, requiring the robot to not only distinguish between different colors but also manage the differing physical properties of blocks, balls, and cylinders when placing them on the colored zones.

Task 3:
- **Task Name**: "containerized-cylinder-assembly"
- **Task Description**: "Arrange a set of five cylinders of varying sizes into a container, with the smallest at the bottom, forming a stable ascending order by size."
- **Assets Used**: ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task introduces a challenge of arranging objects by size and ensuring that the placement results in a stable structure inside a container. It tests the robot's ability to assess size and manipulate objects in a confined space.

I chose Task 2: "sort-and-stack-mixed-shapes" because it stands out for its combination of sorting and stacking multiple shape types and its requirement for precise manipulation and color matching. Unlike previous tasks, it integrates the challenge of handling balls, which can introduce a unique difficulty due to their tendency to roll, along with the more stable blocks and cylinders.

Here is the description of the chosen task in the specified format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "sort-and-stack-mixed-shapes",
    "task-description": "Sort and stack a mixed set of shapes including blocks, balls, and cylinders by color onto corresponding colored zones marked on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

>>> Answer: 
After reviewing the assets and previous task examples, I have designed the following three distinct tasks:

### Task 1: Cylinder Alignment Challenge
**Task Description:** Arrange a series of differently colored cylinders along a single green line, ensuring each cylinder is standing upright and centered on the line.

**Reasoning:** This task is novel because it combines precision placement with color differentiation and object orientation. The challenge involves aligning objects in a straight line, which is different from stacking or sorting into containers.

**Assets Used:** ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

### Task 2: Pyramid Packing
**Task Description:** Construct a three-tiered pyramid from a given set of boxes, each tier consisting of boxes decreasing in size and alternating colors.

**Reasoning:** This task requires the robot to recognize and manipulate objects of varying sizes and to place them in a specific order. The novelty comes from the need to alternate colors and create a stable structure with decreasing box sizes.

**Assets Used:** ["box/box-template.urdf"]

### Task 3: Container Color Coding
**Task Description:** Place a set of colored balls into matching colored containers, with each container only accepting balls of its respective color.

**Reasoning:** This task involves both color recognition and precise object placement within tight constraints. It is different because it requires the robot to sort objects based on color into multiple containers.

**Assets Used:** ["container/container-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]

I choose **Task 1**. It is the most different because it focuses on precise linear alignment of cylinders, which has not been covered by previous tasks. It also requires maintaining upright orientation of cylinders, which adds an additional layer of challenge that is unique compared to the other tasks.

Here is the description in the requested dictionary format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-alignment-challenge",
    "task-description": "Arrange a series of differently colored cylinders along a single green line, ensuring each cylinder is standing upright and centered on the line.",
    "assets-used": ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robot simulation task. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), training mode, six degrees of freedom (6DoF) setting, pick and place primitive, and camera configurations. It also sets evaluation thresholds for position and rotation, workspace bounds, and initializes task-related variables.

### Reset Method
The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment. It initializes goals, language goals, progress, and rewards. It requires that `assets_root` is set to locate the assets for the task.

### Oracle Method
The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly. It uses perfect RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to calculate the actions needed to achieve the task goals.

### Reward Function
The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It can evaluate based on object poses or zones.

### Done Method
The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed. It returns `True` if the task goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

### Environment Helper Functions
- `is_match`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetries.
- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal`: Returns the current language goal or a completion message if all goals are completed.
- `get_reward`: Returns the current cumulative reward.

### Helper Functions
- `fill_template`: Fills a template file with specified values and returns the path to the temporary file.
- `get_random_size`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown`: Applies a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses (translation and rotation).
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for zones if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions for the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-alignment-challenge" task, as they provide the necessary mechanisms to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must align a series of differently colored cylinders along a single green line. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick and place the cylinders. Each cylinder is given a random initial pose and must be placed upright and centered on the green line. The target pose for each cylinder is calculated based on the line's pose, ensuring that the cylinders are standing upright. The language goals provide instructions for the placement of each cylinder, and the `add_goal` function is used to define the success criteria for the task.

reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and assets provided, here are three different task ideas:

**Task 1: Cylinder Height Sorting**
```python
{
  "task-name": "cylinder-height-sorting",
  "task-description": "Pick up cylinders of varying heights and arrange them in ascending order on the zone marks on the tabletop.",
  "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: This task involves the discrimination of objects based on their height, requiring precise measurement capabilities and manipulation to sort the cylinders correctly according to their height. The task focuses on visual analysis and fine control of the gripper.

**Task 2: Ball Color Classification**
```python
{
  "task-name": "ball-color-classification",
  "task-description": "Classify balls of different colors into designated zones, each marked with a corresponding color on the tabletop.",
  "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: The task focuses on color recognition and spatial reasoning. The robot will need to identify the color of each ball and then place it in the correctly colored zone, which requires both visual perception and accurate placement.

**Task 3: Block Sorting Game**
```python
{
  "task-name": "block-sorting-game",
  "task-description": "Sort blocks of different shapes and colors into matching outline shapes on a fixture, similar to a children's fitting game.",
  "assets-used": ["insertion/fixture.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: This task is akin to a shape-sorting puzzle for children, where the robot must recognize the shape and color of blocks and then place them onto a fixture with matching outlines. It requires visual shape recognition and dexterous manipulation to fit the blocks into the correct positions.

**Choice**: Task 3: Block Sorting Game

*Reason for Choice*: Task 3 offers a unique combination of color and shape recognition that is not present in previously generated tasks. It also involves a playful element that is engaging and challenges both the visual and physical manipulation capabilities of the robot. The task is similar to common pre-school educational toys and can have applications in both robot learning and human-robot interaction studies.

Now, here is the description of Task 3 in the requested format:

```python
{
  "task-name": "block-sorting-game",
  "task-description": "Sort blocks of different shapes and colors into matching outline shapes on a fixture, similar to a children's fitting game.",
  "assets-used": ["insertion/fixture.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` method in the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with a set of default parameters, including the end effector type (`Suction`), the mode (`train`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and a pick-and-place primitive. It also defines the workspace bounds, the evaluation metrics (position and rotation epsilons), and placeholders for goals and language goals.

The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task environment. It requires that the `assets_root` be set to locate the assets needed for the task.

The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide the optimal actions for the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the goals achieved. It also determines if the current goal step is complete and updates the task progress accordingly.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, which is used to determine the success of an episode.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

The `get_random_pose` helper function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` helper function reads a file template and replaces key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` helper function generates a random size for a box within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` helper function assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, its pose, and its category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the metric used for the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for implementing the "cylinder-height-sorting" task, as it will involve defining the task's specific goals, rewards, and completion metrics, as well as the logic for the oracle agent to perform the task optimally.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-height-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

            self.add_goal(objs=[cylinders[i]], matches=np.int32([[1]]), targ_poses=[zone_poses[i]], replace=True,
                          rotations=True, metric='pose', params=None, step_max_reward=1 / n_cylinders,
                          language_goal=language_goal)

        # The task is to sort the cylinders by height, so we need to ensure the heights match the target zones
        # We will use the initial poses of the cylinders as their target poses, sorted by height
        # The cylinders will be placed in ascending order from left to right on the table
```

This code defines a task where cylinders of varying heights must be sorted and placed in ascending order on designated zone marks on the tabletop. The task uses a Suction end-effector to pick up the cylinders, and the target zones are sorted by their x-coordinate to match the ascending order of cylinder heights. The `add_goal` method is used to define the placement goals for each cylinder, with language goals provided for additional clarity.

For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-tower-balance",
    "task-description": "Stack and balance a tower of three differently colored cylinders on top of each other without letting them fall over.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task involves precision in stacking and balance, requiring the robot to delicately place cylinders on top of each other without knocking the tower over, which is a test of both the robot's fine motor skills and the simulation's physics engine.

Task 2:
```
{
    "task-name": "sort-balls-by-size",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of five balls of increasing sizes into a designated zone on the table, in order from smallest to largest.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
The novelty of this task lies in the requirement to discriminate between different sizes of objects, and the challenge is to place them in a sequence, adding complexity to the task.

Task 3:
```
{
    "task-name": "precision-bowl-placement",
    "task-description": "Pick up three differently colored bowls and stack them inside each other in size order without knocking them over.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
This task introduces the challenge of handling objects with concave shapes and requires careful alignment to nest the bowls within each other, testing the robot's ability to maneuver and align objects with precision.

Chosen Task: Task 2

Task 2, "sort-balls-by-size", stands out because it emphasizes the robot's ability to sort objects based on size rather than color or shape, which is different from the previous tasks that focus more on color matching or shape fitting. The task challenges the robot to visually discern between the sizes of the balls and to manipulate them in a specific order, which adds an interesting layer of complexity to the task while remaining feasible within the constraints of tabletop manipulation and the assets provided.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with various attributes such as end-effector type (`ee`), mode, six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), a pick-and-place primitive (`primitive`), and camera configurations (`oracle_cams`). It also defines tolerances for position and rotation (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can generate actions to complete the task using perfect knowledge of the environment.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetries.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random object size within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each subgoal includes:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions for the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing simulation code that can effectively create and manage tasks for a robotic agent in a simulated environment. The agent will use these APIs to interact with the environment, complete tasks, and receive feedback in the form of rewards.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and guidelines, here are three new tabletop manipulation tasks:

**Task 1**
- **Task Name**: Cylinder Precision Stacking
- **Task Description**: Stack five different colored cylinders on top of each other in a specific color order on a marked zone on the tabletop, ensuring they do not topple over.
- **Assets Used**: ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

**Task 2**
- **Task Name**: Ball Sorting Challenge
- **Task Description**: Sort five uniquely colored balls into corresponding colored bowls placed at random locations on the tabletop.
- **Assets Used**: ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]

**Task 3**
- **Task Name**: Containerized Cylinder Arrangement
- **Task Description**: Arrange a set of five cylinders by height, from shortest to tallest, inside a container, ensuring they remain upright.
- **Assets Used**: ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

The task I chose is **Task 1: Cylinder Precision Stacking**. 

I selected this task as it poses a unique challenge in terms of precision and stability. Unlike previous stacking tasks which either involved blocks or required placing objects in containers or zones, this task specifically focuses on stacking cylindrical objects, which are inherently more prone to rolling or toppling due to their shape. The task also involves an additional layer of complexity by specifying a color order for the stacking. The task abides by the physics constraints and is feasible given the manipulation capabilities of a typical robot.

Here is the task formatted as required:

```python
{
    "task-name": "Cylinder Precision Stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack five different colored cylinders on top of each other in a specific color order on a marked zone on the tabletop, ensuring they do not topple over.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base for defining robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, pick and place primitive, camera configuration, and workspace bounds.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly for demonstration or testing purposes.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or if a success condition is met.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Includes functions to fill URDF templates with specific values, get random sizes, and change object colors.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
- **objs (List of obj_id)**: Contains object IDs that are involved in the task.
- **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating which objects correspond to which target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: Specifies the target poses for the objects, each pose being a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
- **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can be matched to any target (True) or if they must match to a unique target (False).
- **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational component.
- **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: Defines the type of goal metric, either matching poses or being within a specified zone.
- **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Provides parameters for each zone if the metric is `zone`, including the target pose and size of the zone.
- **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current step of the task, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- **symmetries**: Specifies the angle in radians around the z-axis for which the object is symmetric, affecting how pose matching is evaluated.
- **language_goal**: Contains a low-level language instruction that describes the goal of the current step.

Understanding these components is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "Cylinder Precision Stacking" task. The task will involve defining the objects, their starting poses, the target poses, and the conditions for successful completion, while ensuring that the objects obey physics and do not collide with each other. The task will also need to specify the reward structure and how the agent's actions will be evaluated against the goals.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "Cylinder Precision Stacking".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where five cylinders of different colors must be stacked in a specific order on a marked zone. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick and place the cylinders vertically. The task is completed when all cylinders are stacked in the correct order without toppling over. Each cylinder's goal is added with a language description that matches the stacking action required.

Do you think your task is sufficently interesting to be added as a new task for future task given that we already have the following task name and descriptions? Moreover, does the simulation code achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task? Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it.

For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "digit-sorting",
 "task-description": "Arrange ten cylindrical objects into two color-coded bowls, five representing the digits 0-4 in the blue bowl and the other five representing 5-9 in the red bowl, based on the height of cylinders which correlate with the digit values.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Reasons for the choice:* This task involves sorting by size (height), which is a new element not present in the previous tasks. It's also a recognition challenge combined with manipulation, requiring the robot to distinguish between cylinders of different heights, adding a novel cognitive dimension to the task.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "sequential-box-loading",
 "task-description": "Load a series of three boxes, each increasing in size, onto a pallet, ensuring that the smallest box is placed first and the largest box last.",
 "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and challenges:* This task introduces the concept of sequencing objects by size before placement, which adds a layer of complexity to the manipulation challenge.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "precision-ball-placement",
 "task-description": "Place five different colored balls onto matching colored lines, ensuring each ball is precisely centered on its corresponding line.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and challenges:* This task requires precision manipulation to align objects with a narrow target (the line), which is different from broader zones or containers used in previous tasks.

**I chose Task 1: "digit-sorting"**
The task stands out due to its unique requirement of sorting objects based on their size which correlates to digit values. It also combines cognitive skills (recognizing different heights as different digits) with physical manipulation skills (placing objects in the corresponding bowls). It's a multi-tiered challenge that involves visual discrimination, decision-making, and fine motor control, which is unlike any of the tasks generated before.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulated environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, initializing goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.

The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the actions needed to match objects to their targets.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's metric, which can be either 'pose' or 'zone'. It updates the task's progress and checks if the current goal step is complete.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed based on the remaining goals and the cumulative rewards.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, considering object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal or a completion description if all goals are completed.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file template and replace placeholders with specific values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation, specifying their URDF file, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the evaluation metric for the task.
- `params`: A list of parameters for the zones if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the goal of the step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the simulation code for the "digit-sorting" task.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "digit-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables.

1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "digit-sorting" in python code block starting with ```python.  Reminder: {'task-name': 'digit-sorting', 'task-description': 'Arrange ten cylindrical objects into two color-coded bowls, five representing the digits 0-4 in the blue bowl and the other five representing 5-9 in the red bowl, based on the height of cylinders which correlate with the digit values.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf']}

```

This code defines a task where ten cylindrical objects, each representing a digit from 0 to 9, are sorted into two color-coded bowls based on their heights. The blue bowl is for digits 0-4, and the red bowl is for digits 5-9. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the objects on the Z axis into the bowls. The `add_goal` method is called twice, once for each bowl, with the corresponding cylinders and target poses. The `step_max_reward` is set to 1 for each goal since there are two goals in total.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Given the constraints and guidelines provided, here are three diverse and feasible tabletop manipulation tasks:

**Task 1: Cylinder Sequence Alignment**
```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-sequence-alignment",
    "task-description": "Arrange a sequence of five cylinders in ascending order of height along a single green line marker on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

**Task 2: Pallet Box Sorting**
```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-box-sorting",
    "task-description": "Sort a mixed set of five differently colored boxes by stacking them in color-specific zones on a pallet, ensuring the stability of the stack.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

**Task 3: Bowl Array Filling**
```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-array-filling",
    "task-description": "Place a set of five different colored balls into a corresponding array of five bowls, matching each ball color with its bowl color.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

I choose Task 3: Bowl Array Filling.

The reasons for this choice are:
- Task 3 includes a color matching challenge which adds complexity and interest to the task.
- It incorporates a one-to-one correspondence between two different types of objects (balls and bowls), which is novel compared to the other tasks.
- The task is clear, specific, and adheres to the guidelines, such as obeying physics and maintaining feasibility within the simulation environment.
- Unlike the previously generated tasks, this task combines the aspects of object sorting and precise placement in a novel configuration, differentiating it from simply stacking or inserting objects.
- The task is scalable and can easily be adjusted for difficulty by changing the number of bowls and balls or introducing distractor objects.

Here is the detailed task description in the requested format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-array-filling",
    "task-description": "Arrange five colored balls into five matching colored bowls, one ball per bowl, testing the robot's color recognition and precise placement skills.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Initializes or resets the task state.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the current task state.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- **Task Completion**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Contains functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes, and color objects.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### Understanding `self.goals`:
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, each defined by a translation (x, y, z) and a rotation quaternion (q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can be matched to any target (True) or if they must be matched uniquely (False).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, either by matching poses or by placing objects within a zone.
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A string providing low-level language instructions for the current subgoal.

The `self.goals` structure is crucial for defining the sequence of actions and conditions that constitute the task. It allows for the specification of multiple steps, each with its own objectives and rewards, and provides the necessary information for the oracle agent to generate expert demonstrations and for the reward function to evaluate the agent's performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where five cylinders of different heights must be arranged in ascending order along a green line marker. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the cylinders vertically. Each cylinder is given a distinct color and a target position along the line. The `add_goal` method is called for each cylinder to specify the desired end state, with the reward being evenly distributed across the cylinders. The language goal provides a description of the task for each cylinder.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "sequential-bowl-filling",
    "task-description": "Fill three differently colored bowls with corresponding colored balls in a sequential order, starting with red, followed by green, and finally blue.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
The novelty in this task comes from the requirement of color coordination and sequential order. The challenge is in the precision required to sort the balls by color and the ability to recognize the sequence in which the colored bowls have to be filled.

Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-tower-balancing",
    "task-description": "Stack cylinders of varying diameters into a descending size order tower on top of the pallet, ensuring the structure remains stable.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf"]
}
```
This task introduces the challenge of balancing objects with varying sizes and the skill of fine manipulation to maintain the stability of the structure. The novelty is the requirement to sort cylinders by size and balance them on a pallet.

Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-insertion-challenge",
    "task-description": "Carefully insert three cylinders of increasing sizes into the corresponding sized holes in a fixture without touching the edges.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "insertion/fixture.urdf"]
}
```
The uniqueness of this task comes from the precision required for the insertion of objects into fixtures with tight tolerances and the progressive difficulty with increasing cylinder sizes. It challenges both the robot's dexterity and its visual discrimination capabilities.

I choose Task 2: "cylinder-tower-balancing". The reason for this choice is that it incorporates the concept of creating a stable structure using objects of varying sizes, which is different from simply stacking or inserting. It demands a higher level of manipulation skill to ensure the tower's balance and stands out due to the structural aspect of the task.

Now describing the chosen task, Task 2:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-tower-balancing",
    "task-description": "Strategically stack cylinders of decreasing diameters in a vertical tower on a pallet, ensuring the resulting structure does not topple over.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf"]
}
```

The "cylinder-tower-balancing" task challenges the robot to perform a delicate balancing act, which requires precise control and an understanding of the center of mass for each cylinder. This task involves recognizing cylinders of different sizes and carefully placing them in order of descending size to create a stable structure. It tests the robot's ability to manipulate objects with accuracy and consistency, ensuring the stability of an increasingly precarious tower as additional cylinders are added.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), and whether the task requires six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`). It also sets up a pick-and-place primitive (`primitive`), camera configurations (`oracle_cams`), and workspace bounds (`bounds`).

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can calculate the perfect action using RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks.
- `reward()`: Calculates the delta reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal or a completion message if all goals are completed.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values and returns the path to the temporary file.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether each object can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the metric used for the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `self.goals` variable is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "sequential-bowl-filling" task. The task will involve creating a sequence of subgoals where each bowl must be filled with balls of the corresponding color in a specific order. The simulation code will need to handle object recognition, sequencing, and precise manipulation to achieve the task goals.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where three differently colored bowls are filled with corresponding colored balls in a specific order. The task uses the Suction end-effector to pick up and move the balls into the bowls. Each ball and bowl is added to the environment with a random pose, and goals are defined for placing each ball into the matching colored bowl. The reward is evenly distributed across the three goals, and language goals are provided for each step.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the assets provided and the guidelines to avoid overlapping with previous tasks, here are three new tasks:

Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-stand-alignment",
 "task-description": "Align a set of five different colored cylinders to the corresponding colored edges marked on a stand, ensuring each cylinder sits flush with the edge.",
 "assets-used": ["stacking/stand.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
The novelty of this task lies in the precision required to align cylinders with the stand's edges by matching colors, which tests both the robot's color recognition and dexterity.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "zone-ball-sorting",
 "task-description": "Sort five uniquely colored balls into correspondingly colored zones on a pallet, each marked with a different shape.",
 "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
This task introduces a sorting challenge that combines color matching with shape recognition, as the colored zones on the pallet will have distinct shapes.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "precise-block-placement",
 "task-description": "Place ten blocks of various colors inside a container, arranging them so that no two blocks of the same color are adjacent to each other.",
 "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```
This task demands strategic planning and spatial reasoning to arrange blocks within the confined space of a container while adhering to the adjacency constraint based on color.

Chosen Task: Task 2

Reason for choice: Task 2, "zone-ball-sorting," is selected because it incorporates a unique combination of color sorting and shape recognition that has not been previously explored in the given examples. It also requires precise placement and manipulation of spherical objects, which presents a distinct physical challenge compared to stacking or aligning flat surfaces.

New Task Description in Natural Language:
The new task, "zone-ball-sorting," involves sorting a set of five balls, each with a unique color, onto a pallet where designated zones are marked with shapes corresponding to the colors of the balls. The robot must recognize the color of each ball and identify the matching colored shape on the pallet to successfully complete the task. This task tests the robot's ability to manipulate spherical objects, discern colors accurately, and recognize different shapes, adding complexity to the tabletop manipulation challenge.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a task. It initializes various parameters and methods that are essential for setting up the task environment, evaluating the task's progress, and providing rewards based on the agent's performance.

### Key Attributes and Methods
- `ee`: The end effector used by the robot (e.g., `Suction`).
- `mode`: The mode of the task, such as 'train'.
- `sixdof`: A boolean indicating if the task allows six degrees of freedom.
- `primitive`: The action primitive used by the robot (e.g., `PickPlace`).
- `oracle_cams`: Configuration for oracle cameras.
- `pos_eps` and `rot_eps`: Positional and rotational thresholds for evaluating task success.
- `bounds`: The workspace bounds within which the task takes place.
- `goals`: A list of subgoals for the task, each described by an 8-tuple.
- `lang_goals`: Language-based goals for the task.
- `progress` and `_rewards`: Metrics for tracking task progress and cumulative rewards.
- `assets_root`: The root directory for task-related assets.

### Oracle Agent
The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide an ideal sequence of actions to accomplish the task based on perfect knowledge of the environment.

### Reward Function and Task Completion Metrics
- `reward`: A method to calculate the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress.
- `done`: A method to determine if the task is completed or has failed.

### Environment Helper Functions
- `is_match`: A method to check if two poses match within a specified threshold.
- `get_random_pose`: A method to get a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.

### Helper Functions
- `fill_template`: A method to read a file and replace key strings with specified values.
- `get_random_size`: A method to get a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown`: A method to randomly color an object with a shade of brown.

### Environment Class
- `add_object`: A method to add an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### Understanding `self.goals`
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target or multiple targets.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions denoting the goal of the step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the simulation code for the "cylinder-stand-alignment" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-stand-alignment".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be aligned with corresponding colored edges on a stand. The `CylinderStandAlignment` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the environment with a stand and cylinders. The cylinders are placed at random positions initially, and the task's goal is to move each cylinder to a specific location on the stand, ensuring that the color of the cylinder matches the color of the target edge. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick up and move the cylinders vertically. Each cylinder's goal is added with a language description, and the `step_max_reward` is set to 1/5 since there are five cylinders to align. The `max_steps` is set to twice the number of goals to provide enough steps to complete the task.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here are three new task concepts:

**Task 1: Cylinder Sort and Stack**
- **Task Description**: Sort five differently colored cylinders by placing each into a correspondingly colored rectangular zone, then stack them in color order within a designated stacking area.
- **Assets Used**: `zone/zone.urdf`, `cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf`

**Task 2: Precision Box Placement**
- **Task Description**: Position five boxes of increasing sizes onto five matching size-specific outlines within a container, ensuring each box fits precisely within its allocated outline.
- **Assets Used**: `container/container-template.urdf`, `box/box-template.urdf`

**Task 3: Ball Transfer Challenge**
- **Task Description**: Transfer five balls of unique colors from a starting zone to a target bowl, using a fixture with a concave surface to carry each ball without dropping.
- **Assets Used**: `bowl/bowl.urdf`, `ball/ball-template.urdf`, `insertion/fixture.urdf`

**Chosen Task**: Task 2

**Reasons for Selection**:
- **Diversity**: Task 2 revolves around precise placement within a constrained space, which differs from sorting, stacking, or sweeping tasks previously generated.
- **Feasibility**: It obeys physics as it requires accurate alignment and doesn't involve unstable stacking or unsupported manipulation.
- **Challenge**: The task involves spatial reasoning and fine control to ensure each box fits in its specific outline without overlaps.
- **Novelty**: Unlike tasks focused on stacking or inserting, this one focuses on fitting objects within a predefined space, akin to a puzzle.

```python
{
    "task-name": "Precision Box Placement",
    "task-description": "Position five boxes of increasing sizes onto five matching size-specific outlines within a container, ensuring each box fits precisely within its allocated outline.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "precision-bowl-stacking",
 "task-description": "Stack three differently colored bowls inside each other without toppling them over, starting with the largest at the bottom and the smallest on top.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
Novelty and challenges: This task involves precision stacking with the additional challenge of managing the stability of nested, rounded objects (bowls) which differs from the typical block stacking. The nested arrangement requires careful alignment and control of the robot gripper to position each bowl without disturbing the underlying ones.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-pallet-arrangement",
 "task-description": "Arrange five colored cylinders on a pallet in a specified color sequence from left to right.",
 "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Novelty and challenges: This task involves spatial arrangement and sequence memory, requiring the robot to place objects (cylinders) in a precise order. It tests the robot's ability to follow a color sequence and handle cylindrical objects, which can roll if not placed properly.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-sorting-in-boxes",
 "task-description": "Sort five colored balls into five separate boxes based on color matching, ensuring each ball neatly fits inside its designated box.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```
Novelty and challenges: This task requires color recognition and delicate handling to place spherical objects (balls) into confined spaces (boxes). The challenge lies in making sure each ball is placed without bouncing out, necessitating precise control.

Chosen task: Task 2 - "cylinder-pallet-arrangement"

Reason for choice: Task 2 stands out as it engages with both color sequence arrangement and manipulation of cylindrical objects, which presents a unique set of challenges compared to stacking or sorting based on color alone. It requires precision in placement to prevent rolling and tests the robot's ability to recognize and follow a specified sequence, making it distinctly different from the block-based or insertion tasks previously generated.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task. It includes the following attributes and methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the task with default parameters, including the end effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, primitive actions, camera configurations, and workspace bounds.
- `reset`: Resets the task state and goals.
- `oracle`: Provides an oracle agent that can generate perfect actions based on the current state and goals.
- `reward`: Calculates the reward based on the current state and how well it matches the goals.
- `done`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold.
- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal`: Returns the current language goal.
- `get_reward`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template`: Fills a URDF template with specified parameters.
- `get_random_size`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown`: Colors an object with a random shade of brown.

### Environment Class
The `Environment` class has a method `add_object` that allows adding objects to the simulation environment. Objects can be categorized as fixed, rigid, or deformable, and are added with a specified pose.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation DoF.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "precision-bowl-stacking" task, as they provide the necessary tools and methods to define the task environment, goals, and the logic for the agent's actions and reward evaluation.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task for stacking three differently colored bowls inside each other. The `PrecisionBowlStacking` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment, including the bowls and their goals. The `reset` method adds three bowls to the environment with random poses and colors, and defines the goals for stacking them in the correct order. The `Suction` end-effector is used to lift the bowls on the Z axis, and the `max_steps` parameter is set to twice the number of goals to allow for enough actions to complete the task. The language goals provide instructions for stacking the bowls, and the target poses are set to the initial poses of the next bowl in the sequence or a pose on the table for the largest bowl.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",

reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
After reviewing the provided assets and the example tasks, I have designed three new tabletop manipulation tasks, each with a unique set of challenges and novelty:

### Task 1: Color-Coordinated Container Filling

**Description**: Sort and place a set of colored balls into a matching colored box, where each box is partially filled with fixed, non-movable obstacles, adding a spatial reasoning challenge to the task.

**Reason for Choice**: This task combines color recognition, precise manipulation to navigate around obstacles within the boxes, and sorting. It is different from previous tasks as it introduces obstruction within the target containers, requiring careful placement strategies.

### Task 2: Pyramid Construction with Bowls and Cylinders

**Description**: Build a pyramid structure by first creating a square base with four bowls and then stacking cylinders on top of them, finishing with a single bowl at the peak.

**Reason for Choice**: This task requires an understanding of both stability and sequence. The differing shapes of the bowls and cylinders introduce an additional layer of complexity compared to stacking homogeneous objects.

### Task 3: Sequential Ball Transfer

**Description**: Transfer a sequence of colored balls from one end of a series of aligned containers to the other, ensuring each ball ends up in a container with a matching colored line inside it.

**Reason for Choice**: This task introduces the challenge of precision in transferring objects between containers, along with the need to follow a specific sequence and match colors, which adds to the cognitive load of the task.

After evaluating the three tasks, I believe **Task 2: Pyramid Construction with Bowls and Cylinders** is the most novel task because it combines elements of stacking and balancing with the challenge of using different shapes. Unlike the previous tasks which involve stacking similar objects, this task requires the robot to manipulate objects with different geometries and to construct a stable structure with a varying base area, which is a unique test of robotic manipulation capabilities.

Now, let me describe Task 2 in the required format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-and-cylinder-pyramid",
    "task-description": "Build a pyramid by creating a square base using four bowls and stack cylinders on top, finishing with a single bowl at the peak.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "balance-the-bowl",
    "task-description": "Place a specified number of balls of varying colors into a bowl without tipping it over, demonstrating precision and balance.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task presents a challenge of not only placing the balls into the bowl but also ensuring that the bowl remains stable, thus testing precision in distributing the weight of the balls evenly.

Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "container-cylinder-stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack a sequence of cylinders of decreasing diameters inside a container without the stack collapsing.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Novelty lies in the precision required to stack cylinders of different sizes inside a container, which may not have been attempted before, especially considering the stability of the stack as the diameters decrease.

Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "color-match-box-insertion",
    "task-description": "Insert boxes of specified colors into correspondingly colored zones marked on the tabletop, with precise alignment.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task involves both the cognitive challenge of matching colors and the physical challenge of precise alignment, making it distinct from simple stacking or insertion tasks.

Chosen Task: Task 2
Reason: Task 2, container-cylinder-stacking, is chosen for its uniqueness in combining the challenge of stacking objects within a confined space (container) and the gradual difficulty introduced by decreasing cylinder sizes. It does not closely overlap with any previous tasks, which mostly focus on stacking on flat surfaces or inserting objects into fixtures. The challenge of ensuring that the stack remains upright and does not collapse is also unique to this task.

Now, I will describe the chosen task in natural language:

```python
{
    "task-name": "container-cylinder-stacking",
    "task-description": "The robot must carefully stack a series of differently sized cylinders within a container, starting with the largest at the bottom, and progressively placing smaller ones on top without knocking over the previously placed cylinders.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
The task "container-cylinder-stacking" tests the robot's ability to handle objects of varying sizes and to understand the concept of size ordering. The additional requirement of preventing the stack from collapsing inside the container tests the robot's precision and gentle manipulation capabilities.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the primitive actions available to the robot (`primitive`). It also sets up the camera configuration (`oracle_cams`), evaluation metrics (`pos_eps`, `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Oracle Agent
The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment, including RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks, to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

### Reward Function and Task Completion Metrics
The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the goals achieved. It uses different metrics such as `pose` and `zone` to evaluate the success of the actions taken by the robot. The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

### Environment Helper Functions
The `is_match` function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors. The `get_random_pose` function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds. The `get_lang_goal` function retrieves the current language goal, and `get_reward` returns the current reward.

### Helper Functions
The `fill_template` function reads a URDF file template and replaces placeholders with actual values to generate a URDF file for an object. The `get_random_size` function generates a random size for an object within specified bounds. The `color_random_brown` function assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
The `add_object` method is part of the environment class, which allows adding objects to the simulation. It takes the URDF file path, the pose of the object, and the category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as inputs.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: The evaluation metric, either `pose` or `zone`.
- `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is `zone`.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the goal of the step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the code for the "balance-the-bowl" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "balance-the-bowl".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "balance-the-bowl" in python code block starting with ```python.  Reminder: {'task-name': 'balance-the-bowl', 'task-description': 'Place a specified number of balls of varying colors into a bowl without tipping it over, demonstrating precision and balance.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf']}

```

This code defines a task where the robot must place a specified number of balls into a bowl without tipping it over. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick up the balls and place them into the bowl. Each ball has a unique color, and the task is completed when all balls are placed in the bowl. The `add_goal` method is used to specify the desired final pose of each ball, which is the same as the bowl's pose, indicating that the balls should be inside the bowl. The reward is distributed equally across all balls, and the task includes a language goal for each step, describing the action to be taken.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],

reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
After examining the provided assets and the examples of good and bad tasks, I have generated three different tasks that adhere to the guidelines and aim to be novel and feasible for tabletop manipulation:

### Task 1: Color-Sequence Cylinder Stacking
- **Task Name:** "color-sequence-cylinder-stacking"
- **Task Description:** "Stack five uniquely colored cylinders on their corresponding colored stands in a specific sequence without toppling them."
- **Assets Used:** ["stacking/stand.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

### Task 2: Ball Sorting with Obstacles
- **Task Name:** "ball-sorting-with-obstacles"
- **Task Description:** "Sort colored balls into matching colored bowls, navigating around a fixed obstacle course created by rows of small boxes."
- **Assets Used:** ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

### Task 3: Precision Box Placement
- **Task Name:** "precision-box-placement"
- **Task Description:** "Arrange colored boxes within a marked boundary zone on the tabletop, ensuring each box is aligned with its allocated corner marker."
- **Assets Used:** ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]

Based on the criteria, I choose **Task 2: Ball Sorting with Obstacles**. This task is selected for the following reasons:

1. **Novelty:** The task combines the sorting action (placing balls into matching bowls) with the added complexity of an obstacle course, which is a new element in comparison to previously generated tasks.
2. **Color and shapes:** The task utilizes different colors for the balls and bowls, and various shapes including balls, bowls, and boxes.
3. **Challenge:** The obstacle course introduces a navigation challenge that requires skillful manipulation to ensure the balls do not collide with the boxes while being sorted.

Here is the task description in the requested format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "ball-sorting-with-obstacles",
    "task-description": "Sort colored balls into matching colored bowls, navigating around a fixed obstacle course created by rows of small boxes.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}

reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-sort-and-stack",
 "task-description": "Pick up uniquely colored cylinders and stack them on the corresponding colored corner markers in ascending order of size.",
 "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
```
Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-transfer-challenge",
 "task-description": "Transfer a set of colored balls from a starting zone to matching colored bowls placed at different locations on the tabletop.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "pallet-box-sequencing",
 "task-description": "Arrange a series of differently sized and colored boxes on a pallet by color and in descending order of size.",
 "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

I chose Task 3: "pallet-box-sequencing".

The reason for this choice is that "pallet-box-sequencing" introduces a new complexity to the task of arranging boxes, not only by stacking them but also by sorting them according to both color and size. It is different from the existing "palletizing-boxes" task, which focuses on stacking homogeneous boxes. The novel aspect here is the requirement of sorting boxes by two criteria before stacking, which adds an additional layer of decision-making and manipulation skill for the robot. This task presents challenges in terms of recognition, sorting, and precise manipulation to ensure the boxes are placed correctly and stably.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (training), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom for the robot. It also sets up a pick-and-place primitive, camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment, clearing goals and progress.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. This is useful for creating demonstrations or for testing.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified tolerance, considering translational and rotational differences.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal, which is a textual description of the task's current subgoal.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to fill in a template file with specific values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target or multiple.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating if the goal is a specific pose or a zone.
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: A textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-sort-and-stack" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where the robot must sort and stack uniquely colored cylinders onto corresponding colored corner markers. The task uses suction as the end-effector to pick up and stack the cylinders. The cylinders are defined with ascending sizes, and the colors are shuffled to ensure randomness. Each cylinder is associated with a corner marker of the same color, and the robot receives a reward for correctly stacking each cylinder. The language goal provides a description of the task for each cylinder, guiding the robot to stack it on the correct corner marker.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here are three task concepts:

### Task 1: Color Match and Stack
- **Task Description**: Stack colored blocks on top of the same colored cylinder, creating a tower that obeys the color matching rule.
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task combines color recognition with precision stacking. The challenge is to handle objects of different shapes (blocks and cylinders), which requires precise alignment and stability control when stacking.

### Task 2: Container Block Arrangement
- **Task Description**: Arrange differently sized blocks to fit snugly within the confines of an open container.
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task focuses on spatial reasoning and the efficient use of space within a container. The robot must understand how to arrange blocks to fit them all inside the container, which may involve interpreting 3D space and object dimensions.

### Task 3: Pallet Tower Puzzle
- **Task Description**: Build a tower by placing increasingly smaller boxes on top of each other on a pallet, without the structure toppling over.
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task introduces a challenge of balance and careful planning as the robot must build a stable structure with a decreasing size gradient. It requires careful manipulation and understanding of center of mass and stability.

**I chose Task 2: Container Block Arrangement.** This task is distinct because, unlike stacking tasks that focus on vertical structures, this task requires the robot to plan and execute horizontal arrangements within a confined space. It also tests the robot's ability to judge sizes and fit objects together without a pre-defined order, which is a new aspect compared to the stacking and insertion tasks listed.

Here is the new task description in the required format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "Container Block Arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange randomly sized boxes within the constraints of an open container, optimizing for space usage.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

>>> Answer: 
Here are three different task ideas:

Task 1:
- Task Name: "tiered-bowl-arrangement"
- Task Description: "Arrange a set of three differently colored bowls into a tiered display, with each bowl inverting and balancing on top of a larger bowl."
- Assets Used: ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
- Novelty and Challenges: This task involves precision manipulation to invert and balance the bowls on top of one another, requiring careful alignment and control to prevent the structure from toppling. It's different because, unlike simply stacking, it requires inverting the bowls, which adds a unique challenge.

Task 2:
- Task Name: "cylinder-lineup"
- Task Description: "Sequentially place five cylinders of unique colors in a straight line on the table, following a specific color sequence."
- Assets Used: ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
- Novelty and Challenges: The task focuses on precise placement and color recognition, requiring the robot to align the cylinders in a strict order, which involves memory and positioning skills. This task is different due to its simplicity but a strong emphasis on the precision of linear arrangement and color sequencing.

Task 3:
- Task Name: "complex-container-filling"
- Task Description: "Pick up five boxes of varying sizes and arrange them into a single container, optimizing for space usage without any gaps."
- Assets Used: ["container/container-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
- Novelty and Challenges: This task demands spatial reasoning to tightly pack different-sized boxes into a container, akin to a 3D puzzle. It differs from previous tasks in that it requires a high level of spatial awareness and planning to achieve an efficient arrangement without gaps.

**I choose Task 3: "complex-container-filling".**

The reasons for my choice are:
1. It introduces spatial optimization challenges that require advanced planning and reasoning, which are more complex compared to the precision required in the other tasks.
2. The variability in box sizes adds to the complexity of the task, making it stand out from the others which have more uniform elements.
3. It simulates a real-world task (e.g., packing for shipping), which could have practical applications and interest in robotics research and industry.

Here's the task description in the requested format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "complex-container-filling",
    "task-description": "Pick up five boxes of varying sizes and arrange them into a single container, optimizing for space usage without any gaps.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ascending-pyramid-stack",
 "task-description": "Stack five differently colored bowls in an ascending pyramid formation, with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top, on a designated zone on the tabletop.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-precision-placement",
 "task-description": "Place five cylinders of unique colors into five corresponding colored bowls without knocking them over, ensuring each cylinder is standing upright within its bowl.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "containerized-block-sorting",
 "task-description": "Sort and place a set of differently colored blocks into containers with matching colored lines, ensuring the blocks do not protrude above the container's edges.",
 "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

I chose Task 3 - "containerized-block-sorting".

Reasons for choice:
- Task 3 is significantly different from the ones previously generated as it involves matching colors between blocks and single-colored lines on containers, which was not previously explored.
- It also incorporates precision constraints, ensuring that the blocks do not protrude above the container's edges, which adds an additional level of complexity and is different from simply stacking or placing objects.
- It does not overlap with any existing tasks, as it is not just stacking or inserting but rather sorting based on color-line matching and involves a constraint on how the blocks are placed within the containers.

Now, the natural language description of the chosen task (Task 3):

Task Name: "Containerized Block Sorting"
Task Description: The task involves taking a set of blocks, each a different color, and placing them into containers. Each container has a single green line painted on it, and the color of the line matches one of the block colors. The robot must sort the blocks by matching each block to a container with the corresponding colored line. The blocks must be placed within the containers without protruding above the edges, requiring precision in placement to ensure a snug fit.

This task is novel because it introduces color matching between objects (blocks) and container features (lines), a sorting component that requires perceiving colors, and a precision placement constraint that challenges the robot's manipulation skills. It also creates an engaging scenario that could be akin to certain real-world packing or sorting operations.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the primitive actions available (`primitive`), and the camera configuration (`oracle_cams`). It also sets up evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds` and `zone_bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle(env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and goals.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Retrieves the current language goal or a completion message if all goals are completed.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs and variables is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "ascending-pyramid-stack" task, which involves stacking bowls in an ascending pyramid formation. The task will require careful consideration of object poses, collision avoidance, and the sequence of actions to achieve the goal while maximizing the reward.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task for stacking five bowls in an ascending pyramid formation. The `AscendingPyramidStack` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment, including the target zone and the bowls with their respective sizes and colors. The `reset` method adds the target zone and the bowls to the environment, and it defines the goals for stacking the bowls in the correct order. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the bowls on the Z axis, which is necessary for stacking. The `add_goal` method is called for each bowl to set the target pose and the language goal that corresponds to the stacking order. The reward is distributed evenly across all the bowls to encourage the correct stacking sequence.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
From the given assets and guidelines, I have generated three new tabletop manipulation tasks:

**Task 1:**
- **Task Name:** Cylinder-Color-Match
- **Task Description:** Align uniquely colored cylinders with their matching color lines drawn on the tabletop without knocking the cylinders over.
- **Assets Used:** ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]

**Task 2:**
- **Task Name:** Bowl-Ball-Sorting
- **Task Description:** Sort and place a set of colored balls into corresponding colored bowls arranged in a circle on the tabletop.
- **Assets Used:** ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]

**Task 3:**
- **Task Name:** Precision-Pallet-Placement
- **Task Description:** Place a series of differently colored boxes onto a pallet, creating a color-gradient pattern from one end of the pallet to the other.
- **Assets Used:** ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

After reviewing the tasks, I choose **Task 3: Precision-Pallet-Placement** as the most novel task. This task is chosen for its uniqueness because it involves creating a gradient pattern with the boxes, which adds complexity in color recognition and spatial arrangement. The task integrates a subtle artistic element by requiring the robot to transition colors smoothly from one end of the pallet to the other. It also offers the challenge of precision placement to achieve the desired aesthetic outcome, while still adhering to the principles of physics and feasibility in a tabletop manipulation context.

Here is the description in the requested format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "Precision-Pallet-Placement",
    "task-description": "Place a series of differently colored boxes onto a pallet, creating a color-gradient pattern from one end of the pallet to the other without toppling them.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "color-coordinated-cylinder-pyramid",
 "task-description": "Create a pyramid using cylinders of different colors by stacking them on a pallet in a 3-2-1 formation, aligning them by their color zones marked on the pallet.",
 "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-and-bowl-matching",
 "task-description": "Place balls of specific colors into matching colored bowls, ensuring each bowl contains only balls of its own color.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "containerize-cylinders",
 "task-description": "Arrange multiple cylinders of varying heights into a container-template, ensuring they fit within the confines without any overlapping.",
 "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

I chose Task 1, "color-coordinated-cylinder-pyramid", as the most different and interesting task because:

- It combines elements of stacking and color coordination in a novel way that has not been previously suggested.
- The pyramid formation introduces a specific structural challenge that requires precise manipulation.
- The additional requirement of aligning the cylinders with color zones on the pallet introduces an interesting spatial reasoning challenge. 
- It also allows for the use of multiple colors and shapes within the task, adding to the complexity and visual appeal.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulated environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (training), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom for the robot. It also sets up a pick-and-place primitive, camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment, and it requires that the `assets_root` directory be set to locate the necessary URDF files for the task.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the actions needed to match objects to their target locations.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the current goal. It can evaluate based on object poses or zones, depending on the metric specified in the goal.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or if it has failed, which is used to determine the success of an episode.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, taking into account object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method reads a URDF template file and replaces placeholders with specific values to generate a customized URDF file for an object.

The `get_random_size` method returns a random size for an object within specified minimum and maximum dimensions.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes a URDF file, a pose, and a category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) and returns the object ID.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the goal of the step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the simulation code for the "color-coordinated-cylinder-pyramid" task.

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coordinated-cylinder-pyramid".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where cylinders of different colors must be stacked on a pallet in a 3-2-1 pyramid formation, with each cylinder aligned to its corresponding color zone on the pallet. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the cylinders vertically and place them accurately. The `reset` method sets up the environment by adding a pallet, cylinders, and color zones, and then defines the goals for stacking the cylinders. Each goal is associated with a language instruction that matches the action to be performed.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "triangle-block-assembly",
    "task-description": "Arrange three differently colored blocks in the shape of a triangle inside a designated assembly zone, with each block touching at least one other block.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```
Explanation: This task is different because it focuses on the spatial relationship between objects, requiring the robot to understand and execute precise placement rather than stacking or sorting by color. It introduces geometric reasoning into the tabletop manipulation domain.

Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-tower-challenge",
    "task-description": "Create a straight vertical stack of five different colored cylinders on a precise location of the pallet, ensuring the colors alternate and do not repeat.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Explanation: This task is novel due to the added complexity of alternation and precision in stacking on a specific location. It challenges both the robot's color recognition abilities and fine motor control to balance and align the cylinders precisely.

Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "sorted-container-packing",
    "task-description": "Pack a container with colored balls, placing them in rows by color, with each row containing an equal number of balls.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
Explanation: This task introduces sorting and spatial arrangement within a confined space. It requires precise control to place the balls without disturbing the existing setup and can be complex depending on the number of colors and balls.

I chose Task 2 - "cylinder-tower-challenge" as the most different and novel task. The reasons for this choice are:

- It combines the elements of stacking (which is common in the other tasks) with the additional challenge of color alternation, which has not been specifically addressed in previous tasks.
- The focus on creating a vertical stack on a specific location of the pallet introduces a precision element that requires the robot to have careful control of its movements.
- The task avoids simple sorting or placing within containers or zones, which are common themes in the previous tasks.

Here's the description of the new task:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-tower-challenge",
    "task-description": "Create a straight vertical stack of five different colored cylinders on a precise location of the pallet, ensuring the colors alternate and do not repeat.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the pick and place primitive (`primitive`), and the oracle cameras configuration (`oracle_cams`). It also sets up evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle(env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and progress.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Retrieves the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the step.

Understanding these components is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "triangle-block-assembly" task, which involves arranging blocks in a specific geometric configuration while adhering to the physics and constraints of the environment.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
After reviewing the provided information and considering the constraints and goals for task diversity and feasibility, here are the three new task designs:

### Task 1: Cylindrical Tower Construction
- **Task Name**: "cylindrical-tower-construction"
- **Task Description**: "Sequentially stack five cylinders of different colors into a vertical tower on a designated zone, ensuring each cylinder is smaller than the one below it."
- **Assets Used**: ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

### Task 2: Ball Sorting Relay
- **Task Name**: "ball-sorting-relay"
- **Task Description**: "Sort five balls of unique colors by carrying them over a line without dropping them, and placing each in a matching colored cylindrical container at the end."
- **Assets Used**: ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

### Task 3: Pallet Box Arrangement
- **Task Name**: "pallet-box-arrangement"
- **Task Description**: "Arrange five boxes of different sizes onto a pallet, placing them in order from largest to smallest while keeping them within the marked boundaries."
- **Assets Used**: ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

Considering the novelty and complexity, I would choose **Task 2: Ball Sorting Relay**. This task is the most different because it introduces a balancing and transportation challenge using a line (not previously used for such a purpose) and requires precise placement into cylindrical containers, which differs from stacking or insertion tasks. Moreover, it combines color matching, object manipulation, and navigation challenges without overlapping with previously designed tasks.

Selected task:
**Task 2**

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with a set of default parameters, including the end effector type (`Suction`), mode (`train`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the pick-and-place primitive used for the task. It also defines the workspace bounds, the evaluation metrics for pose accuracy, and the assets root directory, which must be set before resetting the task.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, clearing goals and progress. The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate perfect actions based on the current state of the environment and the goals of the task. This agent uses perfect RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to determine the actions needed to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the delta rewards for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses either pose matching or zone intersection to evaluate the task's progress and provides rewards accordingly.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, which is used to determine the success of an episode.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds, taking into account the object's size.

The `fill_template` method is a utility function that reads a file template and replaces key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for a box within specified minimum and maximum dimensions.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, the matches between objects and target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are allowed, the evaluation metric, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the step, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides a low-level language instruction for the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "triangle-block-assembly" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where three blocks of different colors must be arranged in a triangle within a designated zone. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick and place the blocks. Each block has a specific target pose that is calculated as an offset from the center of the assembly zone. The `add_goal` method is called for each block to define the task's goals, with the language goal providing a description of the action to be taken for each block. The `max_steps` is set to 6, which is twice the number of goals, to provide enough steps to complete the task.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
After reviewing the provided assets and existing tasks, I propose the following three new tasks:

Task 1:
{
 "task-name": "containerized-cylinder-storage",
 "task-description": "Arrange five differently colored cylinders into a single container, orienting them vertically and in ascending order of height without toppling.",
 "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}

Task 2:
{
 "task-name": "ball-transfer-challenge",
 "task-description": "Transfer a set of colored balls from one bowl to another bowl of the same color using only pick and place actions.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}

Task 3:
{
 "task-name": "pyramid-box-organization",
 "task-description": "Create a pyramid structure using six boxes of varying sizes by placing them on a designated zone in size-descending order.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}

Out of the three tasks, I choose Task 3: pyramid-box-organization, for its novelty and the challenges it presents. This task is distinct due to its focus on creating a stable structure with objects of varying sizes, which adds complexity in terms of planning and manipulation. 

Chosen task: Task 3

Here is the natural language description of the chosen task in the specified format:

{
 "task-name": "pyramid-box-organization",
 "task-description": "Using six uniquely sized boxes, build a pyramid structure on the marked zone, carefully placing them in size-descending order to maintain balance and stability.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}

The novelty of this task lies in its requirement for strategic planning to construct a stable pyramid. The challenge comes from handling boxes of different sizes, which demands careful alignment and balance to prevent the structure from toppling. This task also involves spatial reasoning and the grasp stability of different sized boxes, as well as precision in placing them on the target zone.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (training), six degrees of freedom (False), and a pick-and-place primitive. It also sets up camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task, setting up goals, language goals, progress, and rewards. It requires that the `assets_root` be set to locate the assets needed for the task.

The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal sequence of actions to complete the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the best pick and place actions.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses different metrics such as 'pose' or 'zone' to evaluate the success of actions taken.

The `done` method checks if the task has been completed or if a failure condition has been met.

The `is_match` helper function determines if two poses match within a specified tolerance, considering translational and rotational differences.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method retrieves the current language goal, which provides a textual description of the task's objective.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file template and replace placeholders with actual values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, their target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the evaluation metric, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the step, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides a textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "containerized-cylinder-storage" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "containerized-cylinder-storage".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be arranged into a single container. The `ContainerizedCylinderStorage` class inherits from `Task` and sets up the task environment, including the container and cylinders. The cylinders are sorted by height, and a goal is added for each cylinder to be placed in the container. The `Suction` end-effector is used to handle the cylinders, which are expected to be placed vertically. The `max_steps` is set to 10 to allow for some flexibility in the number of actions the agent can take to complete the task.

For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "vertical-cylinder-alignment",
    "task-description": "Align five different colored cylinders vertically on the designated slot zones on top of a pallet, ensuring each cylinder matches its corresponding color-coded zone without toppling.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-nesting-order",
    "task-description": "Nest three differently colored bowls inside each other in a specific sequence on the table, starting with the smallest bowl at the bottom and the largest on top, without disturbing adjacent objects.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "sequenced-ball-deposit",
    "task-description": "Place a series of five balls in increasing size order into five separate containers, each aligned in a row, without dropping any of the balls outside the containers.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
```

I chose Task 3: "sequenced-ball-deposit". 

This task is significantly different from the previously generated tasks because it introduces both a sequencing challenge and a precision placement challenge. The task involves placing balls of increasing size into separate containers, which adds complexity in terms of both manipulation dexterity and spatial reasoning to ensure each ball fits into its designated container without error. It is unique in its requirement for careful control over the ball placement, as dropping any ball outside of the containers would result in task failure, and it has a novel element of sequencing that has not been used in combination with these assets before.

Here is the chosen task in the requested format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "sequenced-ball-deposit",
    "task-description": "Place a series of five balls in increasing size order into five separate containers, each aligned in a row, without dropping any of the balls outside the containers.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, providing an oracle (perfect agent) for demonstrations, calculating rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for interacting with the environment.

### Key Attributes and Methods
- `self.ee`: The end effector used for the task, in this case, a suction gripper.
- `self.mode`: The mode of the task, which can be 'train' or 'test'.
- `self.sixdof`: A boolean indicating if the task allows six degrees of freedom.
- `self.primitive`: The action primitive used for the task, here it is `PickPlace`.
- `self.oracle_cams`: Configuration for oracle cameras.
- `self.pos_eps` and `self.rot_eps`: Position and rotation thresholds for evaluating task success.
- `self.bounds`: Workspace bounds for the task.
- `self.zone_bounds`: Specific bounds for the placement zones.
- `self.goals`: A list of subgoals for the task, each represented by an 8-tuple.
- `self.lang_goals`: Language-based goals for the task.
- `self.progress`: A metric indicating the progress of the task.
- `self._rewards`: Cumulative rewards earned during the task.
- `self.assets_root`: The root directory for task-related assets.

### Environment Class
- `add_object`: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of subgoals for the task, where each subgoal is represented by an 8-tuple containing the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each with a translation and rotation component.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: Additional parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "vertical-cylinder-alignment" task, as they provide the necessary tools and information to define the task logic, object interactions, and success criteria within the simulation environment.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "vertical-cylinder-alignment".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be aligned vertically on corresponding color-coded zones on a pallet. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the cylinders on the Z axis. Each cylinder and zone is added to the environment, and a goal is set for each cylinder to be placed in the correct zone. The `max_steps` is set to 10 to provide enough steps to complete the task, assuming two steps per cylinder. The `lang_template` provides a language-based goal for each action, guiding the agent to align the cylinders correctly.

Do you think your task is sufficently interesting to be added as a new task for future task given that we already have the following task name and descriptions? Moreover, does the simulation code achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task? Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Considering the given examples, and the constraints for tabletop manipulation tasks, here are three distinct task ideas:

Task 1: "Cylinder Ring Toss"
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-ring-toss",
 "task-description": "Place a set of five different colored cylinders as targets on a table and toss a set of five correspondingly colored rings over each cylinder.",
 "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "ring/ring-template.urdf"] 
}
```
Reasoning: This task involves precision placement at a distance, as well as matching colors, which adds a level of difficulty.

Task 2: "Ball Sorting Bonanza"
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-sorting-bonanza",
 "task-description": "Sort a collection of ten balls of distinct colors into an array of color-coded bowls arranged on the table.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Reasoning: This task requires color recognition and sorting skills, with added complexity due to a larger number of objects to manipulate.

Task 3: "Asymmetric Block Arrangement"
```python
{
 "task-name": "asymmetric-block-arrangement",
 "task-description": "Arrange a sequence of blocks in an asymmetric pattern on a marked zone, ensuring the pattern's mirror image is formed on the opposite side of the zone.",
 "assets-used": ["block/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Reasoning: This task involves spatial understanding and precision in creating a specific arrangement that also needs to be mirrored, which is a unique challenge that has not been mentioned in previous tasks.

I choose Task 3: "Asymmetric Block Arrangement".

The task involves placing blocks on a marked tabletop zone to create a pattern that is not symmetric along any axis. The challenge comes from the need to form an exact mirror image of the original pattern on the opposite side of the zone without overlap, requiring precise control and spatial reasoning. This task is novel as it requires the robot to understand and execute the concept of asymmetry and mirroring, which differs from tasks that simply involve stacking or inserting objects based on color or shape. It also demands a higher degree of manipulation dexterity and planning to ensure that the arrangement on both sides of the zone is correct without any guides other than the initial pattern. The use of blocks of different sizes and orientations can increase the difficulty level.

When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- `ee`: The end effector used for the task (e.g., Suction).
- `mode`: The mode of the task, such as 'train'.
- `sixdof`: A boolean indicating if the task allows six degrees of freedom.
- `primitive`: The action primitive used for manipulation (e.g., PickPlace).
- `oracle_cams`: Configuration for oracle cameras.
- `pos_eps` and `rot_eps`: Positional and rotational thresholds for evaluating task success.
- `bounds`: The workspace bounds within which the task takes place.
- `zone_bounds`: Specific bounds for the placement zone.
- `goals`: A list of subgoals for the task, each described by an 8-tuple.
- `lang_goals`: Language-based goals corresponding to the subgoals.
- `progress`: A metric indicating the progress of the task.
- `assets_root`: The root directory for assets like URDF files.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation tuple.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can be matched to any target (False means each object must match a unique target).
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes a rotational component.
- `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the evaluation metric for the subgoal.
- `params`: Additional parameters relevant to the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The degree of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing a low-level language instruction for the subgoal.

### Environment Class:
- `add_object`: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying their URDF, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

Understanding these components is crucial for designing the "cylinder-ring-toss" task. The task will involve generating cylinder targets and corresponding rings, placing the cylinders within the specified bounds, and defining subgoals for the agent to toss the rings onto the cylinders. The task will need to account for physics and ensure that objects do not collide with each other. The subgoals will be structured as 8-tuples within the `self.goals` list, detailing the objects, target poses, and other parameters necessary for the agent to complete the task successfully.

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-ring-toss".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines the "cylinder-ring-toss" task, where the robot must toss colored rings over corresponding colored cylinders. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the rings in the Z axis. Each cylinder and ring is added to the environment with a random pose, and goals are defined for the robot to toss each ring over the matching cylinder. The `max_steps` is set to 10 to provide enough steps for the robot to attempt to toss all five rings.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here are three different tasks that I've generated:

**Task 1: Color-Matched Cylinder Pyramid**

- **Task Description**: Build a pyramid using cylinders of different colors, where each level of the pyramid must consist of cylinders of the same color, and colors should not repeat in any two consecutive levels.
- **Assets Used**: ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]

**Task 2: Sequential Box Arrangement**

- **Task Description**: Arrange a series of boxes in increasing size order within a designated rectangular zone on the table, ensuring that all boxes are aligned with the longest side of the zone.
- **Assets Used**: ["box/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]

**Task 3: Bowl Hierarchy Sorting**

- **Task Description**: Stack bowls within a larger fixture bowl in descending order of size while matching the color of the bowls to colored markers within the fixture bowl.
- **Assets Used**: ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "insertion/fixture.urdf"]

**Chosen Task: Task 2 - Sequential Box Arrangement**

The reason for choosing Task 2 is that it incorporates an element of spatial reasoning and precision placement that differs from the typical stacking or inserting tasks. It requires the robot to recognize and sort boxes by size, align them properly, and manage space within a confined area, which adds complexity and novelty to the task. This task also satisfies the criteria of obeying physics and remaining feasible, as it does not require any ambivalent maneuvers or unsupported interactions with the available assets.

Here is the task description in the required format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "Sequential Box Arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a series of boxes in increasing size order within a designated rectangular zone on the table, ensuring that all boxes are aligned with the longest side of the zone.",
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and avoiding overlap with previous tasks, here are three diverse and feasible tabletop manipulation task ideas:

**Task 1: Cylinder Color Match**
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-color-match",
 "task-description": "Arrange a set of five differently colored cylinders on corresponding colored lines drawn on the tabletop.",
 "assets-used": ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges:*
This task combines color recognition with precise placement. The challenge lies in aligning the cylindrical objects onto the colored lines accurately. The task tests the robot's ability to manipulate and align objects with precision.

**Task 2: Tower of Hanoi Reimagined**
```python
{
 "task-name": "tower-of-hanoi-reimagined",
 "task-description": "Transfer a stack of three increasingly smaller boxes from one zone to another, one at a time, without placing a larger box on top of a smaller one.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges:*
This task is a variation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, implemented with boxes and zones. It requires strategic planning and sequence generation to move the boxes according to the rules, making it a cognitive challenge rather than just a test of manipulation skills.

**Task 3: Ball Sorting Challenge**
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-sorting-challenge",
 "task-description": "Sort and place five uniquely colored balls into five separate bowls aligned in a row, each corresponding to the color of the ball.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges:*
This task involves color sorting and precise placement of spherical objects, which can roll away if not handled carefully. The challenge is to sort the balls and successfully place them into their respective bowls without errors or causing the balls to roll out.

**Chosen Task: Task 3 - Ball Sorting Challenge**

Reason for Choice:
The Ball Sorting Challenge (Task 3) is the most distinctive of the three because it integrates the aspects of both color recognition and precise manipulation of spherical objects, which tend to be more unpredictable in their movement. This task also stands out due to the use of multiple bowls and balls, creating a colorful and visually appealing setup. It requires the robot to skillfully handle objects that have a tendency to roll, adding an extra layer of difficulty compared to the manipulation of static objects.

```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-sorting-challenge",
 "task-description": "Sort and place five uniquely colored balls into five separate bowls aligned in a row, each corresponding to the color of the ball.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base for defining robotic manipulation tasks. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

**Key Components:**
- `ee`: The end effector used for the task, in this case, a suction gripper.
- `mode`: The mode of operation, which can be 'train' or 'test'.
- `sixdof`: A boolean indicating if the task allows six degrees of freedom for manipulation.
- `primitive`: The manipulation primitive used, here it is `PickPlace`.
- `oracle_cams`: Configuration for oracle cameras.
- `pos_eps` and `rot_eps`: Positional and rotational thresholds for evaluating task success.
- `bounds`: The workspace bounds within which the task takes place.
- `zone_bounds`: Specific bounds for zones within the workspace.
- `goals`: A list of subgoals for the task, each described by an 8-tuple.
- `lang_goals`: Language-based goals corresponding to the subgoals in `goals`.
- `progress`: A metric indicating the progress of the task.
- `assets_root`: The root directory for assets like URDF files.

**`self.goals` Variable:**
- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects (`objs`) and target positions (`targs`). The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation vector and a rotation quaternion.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can be matched to targets uniquely or not.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric, either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for general area placement.
- `params`: Additional parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if `metric` is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal, independent of the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.

**Environment Class:**
- `add_object`: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying their URDF, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The task "cylinder-color-match" will require defining a set of cylinders and corresponding colored lines on the tabletop. The robot will need to recognize the color of each cylinder and place it on the matching colored line. The task will be completed when all cylinders are correctly placed on their corresponding lines within the specified positional and rotational tolerances.

The `oracle` method provides an example of how an oracle agent would solve the task, using perfect knowledge of the environment. The `reward` method calculates the reward based on the current state of the task, and the `done` method checks if the task has been completed successfully.

The `is_match` helper function is used to determine if an object's pose matches the target pose within the defined tolerances. The `get_random_pose` function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the simulation code for the "cylinder-color-match" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics and do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds above the table.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-color-match".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be placed on corresponding colored lines. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick and place the cylinders. Each cylinder and line is added to the environment with a random pose, and goals are defined for placing each cylinder on the matching line. The `max_steps` is set to 10, allowing for two attempts per cylinder. The `lang_template` provides a language-based goal for each action, enhancing the task's description.

Do you think your task is sufficently interesting to be added as a new task for future task given that we already have the following task name and descriptions? Moreover, does the simulation code achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task? Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "bi-level-block-organization", 
    "task-description": "Arrange four uniquely colored blocks on two different height stands, so each stand holds two blocks with matching colors.", 
    "assets-used": ["stacking/block.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task involves spatial reasoning to organize blocks based on color as well as understanding different heights at which they should be placed. It requires the robot to discern color and height, adding layers of complexity to the task.

Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-on-pallet-placement",
    "task-description": "Place three differently colored bowls onto specific locations on a pallet, aligning each bowl with its corresponding colored zone marker.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task combines the placement of objects with specific locations and includes the need for precise alignment. It adds another dimension to the task by incorporating the use of a pallet as the placement surface.

Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-sequence-alignment",
    "task-description": "Align five different colored cylinders in ascending order of their height along a single green line on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task introduces a sequencing challenge, requiring the robot to order objects by height, which adds a measurable attribute that needs to be assessed by the robot, aside from just colors.

I chose Task 3, "cylinder-sequence-alignment". This task is distinct because it combines color recognition, size differentiation, and precise linear alignment, offering a unique challenge that has not been presented in previous tasks. It is also feasible due to the use of clearly defined and simple-to-interact-with shapes, and it respects physical constraints given that the cylinders can be stably placed on a flat surface.

Now, let's describe the task in the requested format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-sequence-alignment",
    "task-description": "Align five different colored cylinders in ascending order of their height along a single green line on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the primitive action (`primitive`) used by the robot. It also sets up the camera configuration (`oracle_cams`), evaluation thresholds (`pos_eps`, `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can calculate the perfect action based on the current state.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and progress.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Determines if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Retrieves the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "bi-level-block-organization" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define the task's goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where four blocks of unique colors must be placed on two stands of different heights. Each stand should hold two blocks with matching colors. The `Suction` end-effector is used because we need to move objects along the Z-axis. The `max_steps` is set to 4, allowing two steps for each goal (placing a block on a stand). The `reset` method adds the stands and blocks to the environment and defines the goals for placing the blocks on the stands. The `add_goal` method is used to specify the desired end state for each block, with the language goal providing a description of the task to be completed.

Do you think your task is sufficently interesting to be added as a new task for future task given that we already have the following task name and descriptions? Moreover, does the simulation code achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task? Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
After considering the constraints and previously generated tasks, here are three new task ideas:

**Task 1: Sequential Block Sorting**
```json
{
    "task-name": "sequential-block-sorting",
    "task-description": "Pick up colored blocks in a specific sequence and place them into correspondingly colored zones marked on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: This task involves both color recognition and memory, as the robot has to remember the sequence in which the blocks are to be placed. It is different from previous tasks which did not require following a specific sequence.

**Task 2: Ball and Bowl Arrangement**
```json
{
    "task-name": "ball-and-bowl-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of differently colored balls into bowls of matching color, ensuring each bowl contains the same number of balls.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: The task uniquely combines color matching with the challenge of even distribution of objects across containers, which is different from simply placing objects in containers.

**Task 3: Pallet Block Sorting**
```json
{
    "task-name": "pallet-block-sorting",
    "task-description": "Sort different-colored blocks by placing them on designated color-matched zones on a pallet, arranging each color in a single row without stacking.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: This task requires precise placement of objects in a constrained space (pallet), with color matching and spatial arrangement without stacking, differing from tasks that involve stacking or single-object placement.

**Chosen Task: Task 3 - Pallet Block Sorting**

The reason for choosing Task 3 is that it introduces a new element of spatial organization on a pallet, which is a common industrial application but has not been addressed in the previous tasks. This task combines color recognition, precision in placement, and the challenge of organizing objects within the confined space of a pallet, each in a single layer defined by color-coded zones, which adds to its complexity and novelty.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining various tasks in a simulated environment. It initializes with default parameters such as the end effector type (`Suction`), the mode (`train`), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`). It also sets up a pick-and-place primitive, camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment, initializing goals, language goals, progress, and rewards. The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment, which is useful for demonstrations or testing.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It checks if the objects match their target poses or if they are correctly placed within a designated zone, depending on the metric used (`pose` or `zone`).

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or if a certain reward threshold has been reached, indicating success.

The `is_match` helper function determines if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, taking into account any symmetries of the object around the z-axis.

The `get_random_pose` function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds, considering the object's size.

The `fill_template` function reads a file template and replaces key strings with specified values, which is useful for generating URDF files with specific parameters.

The `get_random_size` function generates a random size for a box within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` function assigns a random brown color to an object, which could be used for visual variety or to simulate different materials.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, its pose, and its category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) and returns the object ID.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, how they match with target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the metric for success, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the step, and any symmetries the objects may have. The `language_goal` provides a textual description of the current subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "sequential-block-sorting" task, as they provide the necessary tools and information to simulate the task environment, define goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "sequential-block-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "sequential-block-sorting" in python code block starting with ```python.

```

Explanation:
- The `SequentialBlockSorting` class inherits from the `Task` base class and defines a task where colored blocks must be sorted into matching colored zones.
- The `__init__` method sets up the task parameters, including the maximum number of steps, language templates for goals, and the suction end-effector for picking up blocks.
- The `reset` method is called to set up the environment at the beginning of each episode:
  - It defines the number of blocks and zones, as well as their sizes.
  - It creates a list of colors and shuffles them to randomize the sorting order.
  - Zones are added to the environment with corresponding colors, and their poses are stored.
  - Blocks are added to the environment with corresponding colors.
  - Goals are added for each block to be placed in the matching color zone, with the language goal describing the action.
  - The goals are reversed to ensure the sorting starts with the first block in the sequence.
- The `max_steps` is set to twice the number of goals, assuming each block requires two steps (pick and place).
- The `Suction` end-effector is used because blocks need to be moved on the Z axis to be picked up and placed.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "corner-block-classification",
    "task-description": "Sort four differently colored blocks into their respective color-coded L-shaped corners on the tabletop without stacking them.",
    "assets-used": ["corner/corner-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "zone-pallet-assembly",
    "task-description": "Arrange differently sized boxes on a set of target zones, each marked on a pallet, ensuring that the size of the box matches the size of the zone.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "sequential-bowl-filling",
    "task-description": "Place a series of balls into three bowls in ascending order of size with the smallest bowl receiving a small ball and the largest receiving a large ball.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

I chose **Task 2** - `zone-pallet-assembly` because it combines elements from stacking tasks and precision placement tasks without direct overlap with any prior task. It challenges both the robot's ability to recognize size and match it to a corresponding zone and its dexterity in placing objects on a pallet, which is a common industrial application. It is also more unique when compared to simple sorting or stacking, and it requires an understanding of spatial relations and size discrimination.

Here is the description of the chosen task (Task 2) in the specified format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "zone-pallet-assembly",
    "task-description": "Arrange differently sized boxes on a set of target zones, each marked on a pallet, ensuring that the size of the box matches the size of the zone.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (train), six degrees of freedom (False), and a pick-and-place primitive. It also sets up the workspace bounds, evaluation metrics, and assets root directory.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task, initializing goals, progress, and rewards.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It can evaluate based on object poses or zones.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, based on whether all goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, taking into account object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` helper function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` helper function reads a file template and replaces key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` helper function generates a random size for a box within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` helper function assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the environment, specifying whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating if the goal is a pose or a zone.
- `params`: A list of parameters for zones if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the goal of the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "corner-block-classification" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where four differently colored blocks must be sorted into their respective color-coded L-shaped corners. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the blocks on the Z axis. The `reset` method adds the corners and blocks to the environment, shuffles the block colors for variability, and sets the goals for each block to be placed in the matching corner. The `max_steps` is set to 8, allowing for two actions per block, and the language template provides instructions for the task.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the given assets and constraints, here are three new tabletop manipulation task ideas:

### Task 1: Color-Gradient Tower Building
- **Task Description**: Construct a tower using cylinders of different sizes, arranging them from the largest at the bottom to the smallest at the top, with a gradient of colors from red at the bottom to blue at the top.
- **Novelty**: This task involves understanding the size gradient as well as the color gradient, which is different from stacking tasks based solely on size or color.
- **Challenges**: The task requires precise manipulation to ensure that the cylinders are placed accurately without toppling the tower, with an additional cognitive layer of arranging colors in a gradient.
- **Assets Used**: ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

### Task 2: Sequential Box Loading
- **Task Description**: Load a series of colored boxes onto a pallet, following a specific sequence that alternates colors and sizes in a repeating pattern.
- **Novelty**: Unlike simple stacking, this task introduces a pattern recognition and memory component, which increases the complexity of the task.
- **Challenges**: The robot must recognize and remember the sequence pattern, select the correct box accordingly, and ensure stable placement on the pallet.
- **Assets Used**: ["box/box-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf"]

### Task 3: Triangular Ball Arrangement
- **Task Description**: Place five balls of different colors into a triangular formation on the tabletop, ensuring the vertex balls match the color of nearby zone markers.
- **Novelty**: This task combines color matching with spatial reasoning to form a specific geometric shape with the objects.
- **Challenges**: The task requires precision in placement to maintain the triangular formation while also matching the colors to designated areas.
- **Assets Used**: ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]

**I chose Task 3: Triangular Ball Arrangement.** This task is selected because it is distinct from the previous tasks in terms of combining color matching with the creation of a specific geometric pattern, which introduces an interesting spatial challenge. It deviates from the stacking and insertion tasks and focuses on precise placement and pattern recognition, which are key components of tabletop manipulation.

Here is the task formatted as per your instructions:

```python
{
    "task-name": "triangular-ball-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Place five balls of different colors into a triangular formation on the tabletop, ensuring the vertex balls match the color of nearby zone markers.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and guidelines, I've generated the following tasks:

**Task 1:**
- **Task Name:** "Tiered Tower Construction"
- **Task Description:** Construct a tiered tower on a pallet by stacking three layers of differently sized cylinders with the largest at the base and the smallest on top, ensuring stability and alignment with the center of the pallet.
- **Assets Used:** ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

**Task 2:**
- **Task Name:** "Selective Ball Sorting"
- **Task Description:** Sort and place balls of specific colors into designated zones, avoiding balls of colors not mentioned in the task.
- **Assets Used:** ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]

**Task 3:**
- **Task Name:** "Container Tower Stacking"
- **Task Description:** Stack containers in a pyramid form with three containers at the base and one at the top, aligning them precisely to form a tidy structure without any overhang.
- **Assets Used:** ["container/container-template.urdf"]

After reviewing the tasks generated, I have chosen **Task 1: "Tiered Tower Construction"**. 

The reasons for my choice are as follows:
- It differs from the previous stacking tasks by requiring the construction of a tiered tower with cylinders of different sizes, which presents a unique challenge in terms of stability and precision.
- It introduces a vertical alignment challenge on a different asset, i.e., a pallet, rather than a table or a stand.
- The task involves an understanding of the center of mass and careful manipulation to ensure the tower's stability, adding complexity and physical realism.
- It does not overlap with the previous tasks, which utilize blocks for stacking or cylinders for color matching, but instead, it combines stacking with size differentiation.

Now, let's describe the task:

```python
task = {
    "task-name": "Tiered Tower Construction",
    "task-description": "Construct a tiered tower on a pallet by stacking three layers of differently sized cylinders with the largest at the base and the smallest on top, ensuring stability and alignment with the center of the pallet.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state of the task and the progress towards the goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Contains functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes, and apply random colors to objects.

### `add_object` Method:
- **Purpose**: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).
- **Parameters**: `urdf` (path to the object's URDF file), `pose` (tuple of position and orientation), `category` (type of object).

### `self.goals` Variable:
- **objs**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the task.
- **matches**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects (`objs`) and target poses (`targs`). The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- **targ_poses**: A list of target poses, each defined by a translation vector and a rotation quaternion.
- **replace**: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- **rotations**: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- **metric**: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the task, either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for area-based placement.
- **params**: Additional parameters relevant to the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- **step_max_reward**: The maximum reward for completing a step in the task, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- **language_goal**: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

Understanding these components is crucial for writing the code for the "Tiered Tower Construction" task, as they provide the necessary tools and functions to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task for constructing a tiered tower with three differently sized cylinders. The task involves stacking the cylinders on a pallet, with the largest at the base and the smallest on top. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the cylinders vertically, and the target poses are calculated based on the center of the pallet and the sizes of the cylinders. The `add_goal` method is called for each cylinder to define the task's goals, with language instructions provided for each step.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-pyramid-precision",
 "task-description": "Sequentially stack 4 differently colored cylinders into a pyramid on a pallet, with the largest at the base and the smallest at the top, without the structure toppling over.",
 "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task introduces the challenge of precision stacking with cylindrical objects, which is a variation from the usual block stacking. It involves careful manipulation to ensure stability and balance in a pyramid structure.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "bowl-height-ordering",
 "task-description": "Arrange three bowls of differing sizes into a vertical stack on the zone marker in ascending order of height starting with the smallest at the bottom.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task requires the robot to recognize and sort objects by size and complete a precise stacking order, which differs from color-based sorting or stacking tasks.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-line-up",
 "task-description": "Place a series of five cylinders of varying heights and colors in an ascending height order on a single green line marked on the tabletop.",
 "assets-used": ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: The task combines color recognition with size discrimination and requires fine motor control to align cylinders along a straight line.

Chosen Task: Task 3 - "cylinder-line-up"

The chosen task, "cylinder-line-up," stands out because it requires the robot to execute a task that involves sorting objects not only by color but also by size in a single dimension (height), and to do so with precision alignment on a marked line. The challenges include accurate perception of cylinder height, color recognition, and precise control to place the cylinders correctly along the line without knocking them over. It also provides a visually distinct task from the others due to its linear arrangement and the combination of color and size sorting.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: This is the base class for tasks, which includes initialization of the environment, reward function, task completion metrics, and helper functions for the environment.

- `reset`: This method resets the task environment, including goals and progress.

- `oracle`: This method provides an oracle agent that can calculate the perfect action based on the current state of the environment.

- `reward`: This method calculates the delta reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.

- `done`: This method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

- `is_match`: This helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold.

- `get_random_pose`: This method generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.

- `get_lang_goal`: This method retrieves the current language goal.

- `get_reward`: This method returns the current cumulative reward.

- `fill_template`: This helper function reads a file and replaces key strings with specified values.

- `get_random_size`: This method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

- `color_random_brown`: This method assigns a random brown color to an object.

- `add_object`: This method adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with one unique target or multiple targets.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric, either 'pose' for matching object poses or 'zone' for measuring object intersection with a zone.
- `params`: A list of parameters relevant to the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: A float representing the total reward for matching all objects with all target poses for the current subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-pyramid-precision" task, as they provide the necessary tools to interact with the environment, define goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-pyramid-precision".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables.

Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "cylinder-pyramid-precision" in python code block starting with ```python.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-tower-challenge",
    "task-description": "Stack three differently colored bowls upside down in a vertical tower without letting the tower fall over, with the smallest bowl on top and the largest at the bottom.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons for choice: This task focuses on precision stacking with an added challenge due to the bowls' curved surfaces, which introduces instability compared to flat surfaces.

Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "color-bracket-sorting",
    "task-description": "Sort and place five differently colored blocks into their corresponding colored zones, ensuring each block is precisely aligned within its zone boundaries.",
    "assets-used": ["stacking/block.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons for choice: This task involves both sorting and precise placement, requiring color recognition and spatial accuracy.

Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-balancing-act",
    "task-description": "Balance a specified number of differently colored cylinders on a pallet, where each cylinder must stand on one of its ends without toppling over.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons for choice: Balancing cylinders on their ends introduces a unique challenge that requires careful manipulation and stability control.

Choosing Task 3: "pallet-balancing-act"

The "pallet-balancing-act" task is chosen because it is significantly different from the previous tasks generated. It introduces a balance component that is not present in other stacking or sorting tasks. It requires a robot to manipulate each cylinder with precision to ensure that it remains vertical and does not fall, testing both the robot's steady handling and its ability to judge and adjust for the cylinder's center of mass. The use of a pallet as the base for balancing adds another layer of difficulty because the robot must place the cylinders in such a way that the weight is evenly distributed to maintain overall stability.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the pick-and-place primitive (`primitive`). It also sets up the camera configuration (`oracle_cams`), evaluation thresholds (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment.
- `oracle(env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random object size within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "bowl-tower-challenge" task, which involves stacking bowls in a specific order without collisions and within the bounds of the workspace. The task will be completed by an agent using the pick-and-place primitive to move the bowls to their target poses, guided by the subgoals defined in `self.goals`.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "bowl-tower-challenge".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where three bowls of different sizes and colors are to be stacked in a specific order to form a tower. The `BowlTowerChallenge` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment, including the bowls and their target positions. The `reset` method is called to initialize the task state, and the `add_goal` method is used to define the goals for the task. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick up and place the bowls, and the task is described using language templates for each step. The target poses are calculated based on the size of the bowls to ensure they stack correctly.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-tower-construction",
    "task-description": "Stack five differently colored bowls in descending order of size to form a tower on a designated zone without the structure toppling over.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-line-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a line of five uniformly sized cylinders of different colors along a green line on the table, ordered from one end to the other by ascending hue value.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```
Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "container-balancing-act",
    "task-description": "Place five balls of unique colors into a container, ensuring each ball is balanced on the container's edge without falling inside or outside.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
```

Selected Task: Task 2

The selected task "cylinder-line-arrangement" involves precision placement and an understanding of color order. It is novel because it requires the robot to align objects in a straight line according to a gradient of color, which has not been done in previous tasks. The challenge lies in correctly identifying the color hues and placing the cylinders precisely along the line.

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-line-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a line of five uniformly sized cylinders of different colors along a green line on the table, ordered from one end to the other by ascending hue value.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes various parameters and methods that are essential for setting up and running a task in a simulated environment.

- **Initialization**: The constructor sets up the end effector (suction), mode (train), six degrees of freedom (sixdof), pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds for position and rotation, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

- **Reset Method**: The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment. It clears goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.

- **Oracle Agent**: The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide perfect actions to accomplish the task. It uses perfect RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to calculate the actions.

- **Reward Function**: The `reward` method calculates the delta rewards for the current timestep based on the task's metric (pose or zone) and the progress towards the goals.

- **Done Method**: The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

- **Environment Helper Functions**: These include methods like `is_match` to check if two poses match within a threshold, `get_random_pose` for a collision-free object pose, and `get_lang_goal` to get the current language goal.

- **Helper Functions**: These include methods like `fill_template` to read and replace strings in a file, `get_random_size` for a random box size, and `color_random_brown` to change the color of an object to a random brown shade.

### Environment Class
The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment. It takes the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments and returns the object ID.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains:

- **objs**: A list of object IDs.
- **matches**: A binary matrix indicating which object matches which target.
- **targ_poses**: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- **replace**: A boolean indicating if an object can match with multiple targets or just one.
- **rotations**: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- **metric**: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the evaluation metric for the task.
- **params**: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- **step_max_reward**: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- **symmetries**: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- **language_goal**: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing simulation code for the "bowl-tower-construction" task, as they provide the necessary functions and variables to interact with the simulation environment, define the task's goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task for constructing a tower of bowls in a simulated environment. The task involves stacking five bowls of different colors and sizes in descending order on a designated zone. The `Suction` end-effector is used to lift the bowls along the Z-axis. The `reset` method adds a zone to the environment and places the bowls in random positions. Goals are added for each bowl to be stacked on top of the previous one, with language goals describing the action. The `pick_place` primitive is set for the task, allowing the simulated agent to pick and place the bowls.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "triple-tower-timber",
 "task-description": "Create three separate towers by stacking a red cylinder, a green block, and a blue ball respectively on each of three stands, ensuring they balance and do not fall over.",
 "assets-used": ["stacking/stand.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "container-color-coordination",
 "task-description": "Sort five differently colored balls into a container, creating a single layer where each ball is placed in its matching colored zone without stacking.",
 "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "sequential-box-insertion",
 "task-description": "Line up five boxes of ascending sizes next to the L-shaped marker and then sequentially insert them into appropriately sized slots within a fixture.",
 "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf", "insertion/fixture.urdf"]
}
```

I choose **Task 2: container-color-coordination**.

Reasons for choosing Task 2:
- The task involves color matching, which adds an interesting visual search component.
- It requires precise placement in a single layer, adding a constraint that differs from stacking tasks.
- It incorporates the use of zones within a container which is a novel element not seen in the previous tasks.
- It's feasible and respects the physics constraints, as it does not involve stacking balls (which is physically infeasible) but rather placing them in designated areas.

Here is the description of the chosen task:

```python
{
 "task-name": "container-color-coordination",
 "task-description": "Sort five differently colored balls into a container, creating a single layer where each ball is placed in its matching colored zone without stacking.",
 "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` method in the `Environment` class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks.
- It initializes with a suction end effector, a pick-and-place primitive, and a set of default parameters such as workspace bounds and evaluation metrics.
- The `reset` method is used to reset the task state.
- The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions to complete the task using perfect knowledge of the environment.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified tolerance.
- The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal.
- The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.
- The `fill_template` method is a utility to fill a URDF template with specific values.
- The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment. It takes a URDF file path, a pose, and a category indicating whether the object is fixed, rigid, or deformable.

### self.goals Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the steps and requirements to complete the task.
- Each tuple contains:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
  - `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
  - `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
  - `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the current step.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions for the current step.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for writing simulation code and designing tasks that are executable by a robotic agent in a simulated environment. The task must be designed considering the physical constraints of the environment and the capabilities of the agent.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where three different colored objects (a red cylinder, a green block, and a blue ball) must be stacked on three separate stands. The `Suction` end-effector is used because objects need to be lifted and placed precisely. The `max_steps` is set to 6, allowing two steps per object to grasp and place. Each object is added to the environment with a random pose and a corresponding goal is defined for stacking it on a stand. The `add_goal` method is called with the appropriate parameters to set the goals for the task.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "descending-bowl-nesting",
 "task-description": "Nest a set of three bowls of decreasing sizes inside one another on the table, with the largest on the bottom and the smallest on top.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-line-sequencing",
 "task-description": "Place a sequence of five cylinders of different colors along a single green line in ascending order of their heights.",
 "assets-used": ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-box-sorting",
 "task-description": "Sort three balls of unique colors into matching colored boxes, ensuring each ball is placed within its corresponding box.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

**I choose Task 3: ball-box-sorting.**

Reason for choice: Task 3, "ball-box-sorting," involves object recognition (matching ball colors to the corresponding box colors) and precision placement (ensuring each ball is within its designated box). This task stands out because it combines color matching with fine motor control, and it has not been previously listed among generated tasks, ensuring novelty. Moreover, the task remains within the realm of tabletop manipulation and does not require actions outside of the pick-and-place primitive.

### New Task Description (Task 3):
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-box-sorting",
 "task-description": "Sort three balls of unique colors into matching colored boxes, ensuring each ball is placed within its corresponding box.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

This task's novelty lies in its requirement for the robot to use visual perception to differentiate between colors, dexterity to handle spherical objects, and accuracy to place them in a constrained space. The primary challenge of the task is the manipulation of round objects, which can be difficult due to their tendency to roll, and the precision required to place them into the appropriately colored box without misplacing them on the table.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (training), six degrees of freedom (False), and the pick-and-place primitive. It also sets up the workspace bounds, oracle cameras, and evaluation metrics for pose accuracy.

The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task environment, and it requires that the `assets_root` be set to locate the assets needed for the task.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. This agent is used to create demonstrations or to guide the robot in a scripted manner.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the robot's performance. It uses different metrics such as 'pose' or 'zone' to evaluate the robot's actions.

The `done` method checks if the task has been completed or if a failure condition has been met.

The `is_match` helper function determines if two poses match within a specified tolerance, taking into account translational and rotational differences, as well as any symmetries of the object.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method is a utility for reading a file template and replacing placeholders with specific values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment. It takes the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the evaluation metric for the task.
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing simulation code for the "descending-bowl-nesting" task, as they provide the necessary tools and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate the robot's performance.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-balance-on-ball",
 "task-description": "Balance a vertically oriented cylinder on top of a stationary ball without letting it fall over.",
 "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ascending-block-tower",
 "task-description": "Create a tower by stacking blocks of decreasing size on top of each other, starting with the largest at the base and the smallest at the top.",
 "assets-used": ["stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "containerized-box-segregation",
 "task-description": "Sort fixed-sized boxes by color into separate containers, one for each color, ensuring that the boxes are neatly organized within each container.",
 "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

Task Chosen: **Task 1**

Reasons for Choice:
- Task 1, "cylinder-balance-on-ball," presents a unique challenge that is distinct from the prior tasks: the act of balancing a cylindrical object on a spherical surface requires precision and stability, which is not merely a pick-and-place or sorting activity.
- It involves an unusual interaction between two different shapes and tests both the robot's delicate handling and real-time adjustment capabilities to maintain the cylinder's balance.
- The physics involved in keeping a cylinder balanced on a ball is more complex and engaging from a simulation perspective due to the instability that must be overcome, providing a more dynamic task than straightforward stacking or sorting.
- The task does not involve color matching or any other secondary sorting criteria, which is different from most of the previously generated tasks focused on color-coded placement or arrangement.
- This task is feasible within the constraints of the simulation while still presenting a challenging and novel problem to solve.

Now, I will describe the new task, "cylinder-balance-on-ball," in the desired format:

```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-balance-on-ball",
 "task-description": "Balance a single, vertically oriented red cylinder on top of a stationary blue ball without letting it fall over, demonstrating precise control and stability.",
 "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the primitive action (`primitive`), and the camera configuration (`oracle_cams`). It also sets thresholds for pose evaluation (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can calculate the optimal action based on the current state.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random object size within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-balance-on-ball" task. The task will involve creating a simulation environment where a cylinder must be balanced on a ball, and the agent must perform actions to achieve this goal while adhering to the physics constraints and task requirements.

================= Code Generation!

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where a robot must balance a cylinder on top of a ball. The task uses a Suction end-effector to lift and place the cylinder. The ball and cylinder are added to the environment with random poses, and the goal is to place the cylinder on top of the ball. The target pose for the cylinder is calculated based on the ball's position. The task is completed when the cylinder is balanced on the ball.
