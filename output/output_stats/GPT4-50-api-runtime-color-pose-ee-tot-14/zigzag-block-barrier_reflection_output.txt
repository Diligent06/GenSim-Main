{'task-name': 'zigzag-block-barrier', 'task-description': 'Create a zigzag barrier on the table using a sequence of five alternately colored blocks, ensuring that each block is touching the previous one at an angle to form a continuous line.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the others in the list as it requires precise placement of blocks in a zigzag pattern, which is not covered by other tasks. However, the provided code has some issues: the 'get_random_pose' function is not defined within the provided code, and the 'p.getBasePositionAndOrientation' function call is missing the 'pybullet' (p) import and usage context. Additionally, the language descriptions are not sufficiently descriptive and do not provide information on the specific angle or orientation needed for each block, which could lead to ambiguity in task execution.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
