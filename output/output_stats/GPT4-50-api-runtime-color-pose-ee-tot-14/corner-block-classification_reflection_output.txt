{'task-name': 'corner-block-classification', 'task-description': 'Sort four differently colored blocks into their respective color-coded L-shaped corners on the tabletop without stacking them.', 'assets-used': ['corner/corner-template.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is somewhat similar to 'cylinder-sort-and-stack' as it involves sorting objects by color to specific locations. However, it is distinct in that it requires placing objects in L-shaped corners rather than stacking, and uses blocks instead of cylinders. The task is sufficiently different to warrant inclusion, as it adds variety in the form of color matching and spatial arrangement without stacking, which is not covered by the existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
