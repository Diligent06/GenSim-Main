{'task-name': 'Tiered Tower Construction', 'task-description': 'Construct a tiered tower on a pallet by stacking three layers of differently sized cylinders with the largest at the base and the smallest on top, ensuring stability and alignment with the center of the pallet.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the task is conceptually similar to 'precision-bowl-stacking' and 'Cylinder Precision Stacking', it introduces a unique challenge by requiring the construction of a tiered structure on a pallet, which adds an element of spatial constraint and stability not present in the other tasks. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and provides clear language descriptions for each step, which is beneficial for language-conditioned learning. However, the task's novelty may not be sufficiently high to justify its addition, given the existing tasks that involve stacking cylinders or similar objects.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
