{'task-name': 'descending-bowl-nesting', 'task-description': 'Nest a set of three bowls of decreasing sizes inside one another on the table, with the largest on the bottom and the smallest on top.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'precision_bowl_stacking' which also involves stacking bowls in order of size. However, the 'descending-bowl-nesting' task emphasizes the nesting aspect, which could involve more precise control in placing the bowls inside each other without toppling, rather than just stacking. It adds a slight variation to the existing task but might not be sufficiently distinct to warrant a new task category. Moreover, the simulation code provided does achieve the goal and includes language descriptions for each step, which aligns with the task's objective.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
