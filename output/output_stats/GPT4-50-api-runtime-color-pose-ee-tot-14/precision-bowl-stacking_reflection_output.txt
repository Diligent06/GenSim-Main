{'task-name': 'precision-bowl-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack three differently colored bowls inside each other without toppling them over, starting with the largest at the bottom and the smallest on top.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'place-red-in-green' and 'Cylinder Precision Stacking' as it requires precision in both the vertical and horizontal axes to stack the bowls without toppling. Moreover, the task involves a clear sequence of actions and the use of language instructions that are well-aligned with the goals of the task. The simulation code appears to correctly randomize the order of the bowls, set up the goals with appropriate language descriptions, and use the Suction gripper to manipulate the bowls. However, the task may benefit from a more complex setup or additional constraints to increase its difficulty and distinguish it further from 'Cylinder Precision Stacking'.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
