================= Task and Asset Design!

>>> Prompt: 
You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 

=========
Here are all the assets. Use only these assets in the task and code design.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}
- place-red-in-green: {'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the red blocks and place them into the green bowls amidst other objects.', 'task-name': 'place-red-in-green'}
- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}
- stack-block-pyramid: {'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'sequentially stack 6 blocks into a pyramid of 3-2-1 with rainbow colored ordering.', 'task-name': 'stack-block-pyramid'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-tower",
 "task-description": "Stack a tower with alternating colors of five cylinders on top of a flat box, ensuring each cylinder is centered on the one below.",
 "assets-used": [
     "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf",
     "box/box-template.urdf"
 ]
}
```
Reason: This task involves precision stacking of cylindrical objects which presents a different challenge compared to stacking blocks or placing objects in bowls. It also requires color differentiation and alignment skills.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-transfer",
 "task-description": "Transfer a set of five colored balls from one bowl to another using a cylinder as a scoop, without dropping any balls.",
 "assets-used": [
     "ball/ball-template.urdf",
     "bowl/bowl.urdf",
     "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"
 ]
}
```
Reason: This task involves using a cylindrical object in a novel way as a tool to move other objects (balls) between containers. It challenges the robot's ability to manipulate objects with an improvised tool.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "pallete-precision-placement",
 "task-description": "Arrange five different colored boxes in a specific sequence on a pallet, according to a predefined pattern.",
 "assets-used": [
     "box/box-template.urdf",
     "pallet/pallet.urdf"
 ]
}
```
Reason: This task emphasizes pattern recognition and sequence execution, where the robot needs to identify colors and place boxes in a precise arrangement.

Chosen Task: **Task 1**

Reason for Choice: Task 1 ("cylinder-tower") is the most different from previous tasks as it introduces a new shape (cylinders) for stacking, which is not covered by the prior examples. Stacking cylinders requires a different approach to stability and alignment compared to blocks due to their curved surfaces, and the task also includes a color differentiation component. This task will test the robot's precision and balance in manipulation, as well as its ability to handle objects with more complex geometries.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, a pick-and-place primitive, and camera configurations. It also sets thresholds for position and rotation evaluation, workspace bounds, and initializes variables for goals, language goals, progress, rewards, and asset root directory.

The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment, clearing goals and progress.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions for the robot to perform the task perfectly. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the next best action.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses either pose matching or zone intersection to evaluate the task's progress.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, based on whether all goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal, which is a textual description of the task's current goal.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file and replace key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-tower" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way.

Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines the `CylinderTower` task, which involves stacking cylinders of different colors on top of a flat box. The task uses the `Suction` end-effector to move the cylinders vertically and place them on top of each other. The `reset` method adds a base box and five cylinders to the environment, each with a unique color. The cylinders are to be stacked in a random order, with the goal of each cylinder being to be placed on top of the previous one, centered and upright. The `add_goal` method is used to define the motion and language goals for each cylinder, with the `step_max_reward` being divided equally among the number of cylinders to stack. The `primitive` is set to `push`, which is a requirement of the task API, even though the actual end-effector used is `Suction`.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "color-coded-cylinder-placement",
 "task-description": "Arrange five uniquely colored cylinders in a row on the table, matching each to a correspondingly colored zone marker.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task involves recognizing different colors and placing objects with precision. The task is novel because it combines the challenge of color matching with spatial arrangement, which has not been emphasized in previous tasks.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "balanced-bowl-stacking",
 "task-description": "Stack three bowls of different colors on top of each other without toppling, with the smallest bowl on top.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
The novelty here lies in the challenge of delicately balancing objects with a curved base, which is a distinct manipulation task that requires fine motor control and stability assessment.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "precise-ball-placement",
 "task-description": "Place five balls of different colors into five separate, small zones with matching color boundaries without any balls touching the zone edges.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task is unique because it requires precision in placing spherical objects into constrained spaces, which is different from stacking or insertion tasks. The challenge is heightened by the need to avoid contact with the zone boundaries.

**Chosen Task**: Task 3

The chosen task, "precise-ball-placement," stands out as it requires high precision and control to place balls within small, colored boundaries without touching the edges, which differs from tasks that involve stacking, sweeping, or aligning objects. It also incorporates color recognition in a new context of spatial constraints, adding to its uniqueness and challenge.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: A base class for tasks that includes initialization of the environment, reward function, task completion metrics, and helper functions.
- `reset`: Resets the task to its initial state.
- `oracle`: Provides an oracle agent that can calculate the perfect action based on the current state of the environment.
- `reward`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- `done`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.
- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal`: Returns the current language goal if available, otherwise returns a default task completion description.
- `get_reward`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template`: Fills a URDF template with specified values and returns the path to the temporary file.
- `get_random_size`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown`: Colors an object with a random shade of brown.
- `add_object`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each defined by a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with any target (True) or if they must match with a unique target (False).
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the subgoal, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: Additional parameters for the subgoal, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions for the subgoal.

The task "color-coded-cylinder-placement" will require creating a simulation environment where cylinders are placed according to color-coded zones. The task will involve using the APIs to initialize the environment, add objects, define goals, and calculate rewards based on the successful placement of cylinders in their corresponding zones. The task will also need to ensure that the objects obey physics and do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds above the table.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-cylinder-placement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where five uniquely colored cylinders must be placed into correspondingly colored zones. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick and place the cylinders. The task is reset by adding cylinders and zones to the environment, shuffling the colors each time to ensure variability. Goals are added for each cylinder to be placed in the correct zone, with a full reward given for correct placement. The language goal provides a description of the task for each cylinder.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and assets provided, I have generated three different tasks that offer unique challenges and strategic requirements. Here is a brief description of each task:

Task 1:
- **Task Name**: "precision-pallet-cylinder-stack"
- **Task Description**: "Stack a specific number of uniquely colored cylinders onto a single marked area of a pallet, ensuring each is placed without knocking over existing cylinders."
- **Assets Used**: ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task involves precise manipulation to stack cylinders (which are more prone to rolling and misalignment compared to boxes) onto a pallet. It requires careful placement to maintain the stability of the stack. The use of multiple colors adds an element of color recognition and sorting into the task.

Task 2:
- **Task Name**: "sort-and-stack-mixed-shapes"
- **Task Description**: "Sort and stack a mixed set of shapes including blocks, balls, and cylinders by color onto corresponding colored zones marked on the tabletop."
- **Assets Used**: ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task combines sorting with stacking, requiring the robot to not only distinguish between different colors but also manage the differing physical properties of blocks, balls, and cylinders when placing them on the colored zones.

Task 3:
- **Task Name**: "containerized-cylinder-assembly"
- **Task Description**: "Arrange a set of five cylinders of varying sizes into a container, with the smallest at the bottom, forming a stable ascending order by size."
- **Assets Used**: ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
- **Novelty and Challenges**: This task introduces a challenge of arranging objects by size and ensuring that the placement results in a stable structure inside a container. It tests the robot's ability to assess size and manipulate objects in a confined space.

I chose Task 2: "sort-and-stack-mixed-shapes" because it stands out for its combination of sorting and stacking multiple shape types and its requirement for precise manipulation and color matching. Unlike previous tasks, it integrates the challenge of handling balls, which can introduce a unique difficulty due to their tendency to roll, along with the more stable blocks and cylinders.

Here is the description of the chosen task in the specified format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "sort-and-stack-mixed-shapes",
    "task-description": "Sort and stack a mixed set of shapes including blocks, balls, and cylinders by color onto corresponding colored zones marked on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

>>> Answer: 
After reviewing the assets and previous task examples, I have designed the following three distinct tasks:

### Task 1: Cylinder Alignment Challenge
**Task Description:** Arrange a series of differently colored cylinders along a single green line, ensuring each cylinder is standing upright and centered on the line.

**Reasoning:** This task is novel because it combines precision placement with color differentiation and object orientation. The challenge involves aligning objects in a straight line, which is different from stacking or sorting into containers.

**Assets Used:** ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

### Task 2: Pyramid Packing
**Task Description:** Construct a three-tiered pyramid from a given set of boxes, each tier consisting of boxes decreasing in size and alternating colors.

**Reasoning:** This task requires the robot to recognize and manipulate objects of varying sizes and to place them in a specific order. The novelty comes from the need to alternate colors and create a stable structure with decreasing box sizes.

**Assets Used:** ["box/box-template.urdf"]

### Task 3: Container Color Coding
**Task Description:** Place a set of colored balls into matching colored containers, with each container only accepting balls of its respective color.

**Reasoning:** This task involves both color recognition and precise object placement within tight constraints. It is different because it requires the robot to sort objects based on color into multiple containers.

**Assets Used:** ["container/container-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]

I choose **Task 1**. It is the most different because it focuses on precise linear alignment of cylinders, which has not been covered by previous tasks. It also requires maintaining upright orientation of cylinders, which adds an additional layer of challenge that is unique compared to the other tasks.

Here is the description in the requested dictionary format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-alignment-challenge",
    "task-description": "Arrange a series of differently colored cylinders along a single green line, ensuring each cylinder is standing upright and centered on the line.",
    "assets-used": ["line/single-green-line-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robot simulation task. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), training mode, six degrees of freedom (6DoF) setting, pick and place primitive, and camera configurations. It also sets evaluation thresholds for position and rotation, workspace bounds, and initializes task-related variables.

### Reset Method
The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment. It initializes goals, language goals, progress, and rewards. It requires that `assets_root` is set to locate the assets for the task.

### Oracle Method
The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly. It uses perfect RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to calculate the actions needed to achieve the task goals.

### Reward Function
The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It can evaluate based on object poses or zones.

### Done Method
The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed. It returns `True` if the task goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

### Environment Helper Functions
- `is_match`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetries.
- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal`: Returns the current language goal or a completion message if all goals are completed.
- `get_reward`: Returns the current cumulative reward.

### Helper Functions
- `fill_template`: Fills a template file with specified values and returns the path to the temporary file.
- `get_random_size`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown`: Applies a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses (translation and rotation).
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for zones if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions for the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-alignment-challenge" task, as they provide the necessary mechanisms to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must align a series of differently colored cylinders along a single green line. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick and place the cylinders. Each cylinder is given a random initial pose and must be placed upright and centered on the green line. The target pose for each cylinder is calculated based on the line's pose, ensuring that the cylinders are standing upright. The language goals provide instructions for the placement of each cylinder, and the `add_goal` function is used to define the success criteria for the task.

reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and assets provided, here are three different task ideas:

**Task 1: Cylinder Height Sorting**
```python
{
  "task-name": "cylinder-height-sorting",
  "task-description": "Pick up cylinders of varying heights and arrange them in ascending order on the zone marks on the tabletop.",
  "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: This task involves the discrimination of objects based on their height, requiring precise measurement capabilities and manipulation to sort the cylinders correctly according to their height. The task focuses on visual analysis and fine control of the gripper.

**Task 2: Ball Color Classification**
```python
{
  "task-name": "ball-color-classification",
  "task-description": "Classify balls of different colors into designated zones, each marked with a corresponding color on the tabletop.",
  "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: The task focuses on color recognition and spatial reasoning. The robot will need to identify the color of each ball and then place it in the correctly colored zone, which requires both visual perception and accurate placement.

**Task 3: Block Sorting Game**
```python
{
  "task-name": "block-sorting-game",
  "task-description": "Sort blocks of different shapes and colors into matching outline shapes on a fixture, similar to a children's fitting game.",
  "assets-used": ["insertion/fixture.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges*: This task is akin to a shape-sorting puzzle for children, where the robot must recognize the shape and color of blocks and then place them onto a fixture with matching outlines. It requires visual shape recognition and dexterous manipulation to fit the blocks into the correct positions.

**Choice**: Task 3: Block Sorting Game

*Reason for Choice*: Task 3 offers a unique combination of color and shape recognition that is not present in previously generated tasks. It also involves a playful element that is engaging and challenges both the visual and physical manipulation capabilities of the robot. The task is similar to common pre-school educational toys and can have applications in both robot learning and human-robot interaction studies.

Now, here is the description of Task 3 in the requested format:

```python
{
  "task-name": "block-sorting-game",
  "task-description": "Sort blocks of different shapes and colors into matching outline shapes on a fixture, similar to a children's fitting game.",
  "assets-used": ["insertion/fixture.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` method in the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with a set of default parameters, including the end effector type (`Suction`), the mode (`train`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and a pick-and-place primitive. It also defines the workspace bounds, the evaluation metrics (position and rotation epsilons), and placeholders for goals and language goals.

The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task environment. It requires that the `assets_root` be set to locate the assets needed for the task.

The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide the optimal actions for the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the goals achieved. It also determines if the current goal step is complete and updates the task progress accordingly.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, which is used to determine the success of an episode.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

The `get_random_pose` helper function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` helper function reads a file template and replaces key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` helper function generates a random size for a box within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` helper function assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, its pose, and its category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the metric used for the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for implementing the "cylinder-height-sorting" task, as it will involve defining the task's specific goals, rewards, and completion metrics, as well as the logic for the oracle agent to perform the task optimally.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-height-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

            self.add_goal(objs=[cylinders[i]], matches=np.int32([[1]]), targ_poses=[zone_poses[i]], replace=True,
                          rotations=True, metric='pose', params=None, step_max_reward=1 / n_cylinders,
                          language_goal=language_goal)

        # The task is to sort the cylinders by height, so we need to ensure the heights match the target zones
        # We will use the initial poses of the cylinders as their target poses, sorted by height
        # The cylinders will be placed in ascending order from left to right on the table
```

This code defines a task where cylinders of varying heights must be sorted and placed in ascending order on designated zone marks on the tabletop. The task uses a Suction end-effector to pick up the cylinders, and the target zones are sorted by their x-coordinate to match the ascending order of cylinder heights. The `add_goal` method is used to define the placement goals for each cylinder, with language goals provided for additional clarity.

For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-tower-balance",
    "task-description": "Stack and balance a tower of three differently colored cylinders on top of each other without letting them fall over.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task involves precision in stacking and balance, requiring the robot to delicately place cylinders on top of each other without knocking the tower over, which is a test of both the robot's fine motor skills and the simulation's physics engine.

Task 2:
```
{
    "task-name": "sort-balls-by-size",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of five balls of increasing sizes into a designated zone on the table, in order from smallest to largest.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
The novelty of this task lies in the requirement to discriminate between different sizes of objects, and the challenge is to place them in a sequence, adding complexity to the task.

Task 3:
```
{
    "task-name": "precision-bowl-placement",
    "task-description": "Pick up three differently colored bowls and stack them inside each other in size order without knocking them over.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
This task introduces the challenge of handling objects with concave shapes and requires careful alignment to nest the bowls within each other, testing the robot's ability to maneuver and align objects with precision.

Chosen Task: Task 2

Task 2, "sort-balls-by-size", stands out because it emphasizes the robot's ability to sort objects based on size rather than color or shape, which is different from the previous tasks that focus more on color matching or shape fitting. The task challenges the robot to visually discern between the sizes of the balls and to manipulate them in a specific order, which adds an interesting layer of complexity to the task while remaining feasible within the constraints of tabletop manipulation and the assets provided.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with various attributes such as end-effector type (`ee`), mode, six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), a pick-and-place primitive (`primitive`), and camera configurations (`oracle_cams`). It also defines tolerances for position and rotation (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can generate actions to complete the task using perfect knowledge of the environment.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetries.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random object size within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each subgoal includes:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions for the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing simulation code that can effectively create and manage tasks for a robotic agent in a simulated environment. The agent will use these APIs to interact with the environment, complete tasks, and receive feedback in the form of rewards.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "cylinder-tower-balance" in python code block starting with ```python.  Reminder: {'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-balance', 'task-description': 'Stack and balance a tower of three differently colored cylinders on top of each other without letting them fall over.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf']}
