{'task-name': 'color-gradient-tower', 'task-description': 'Stack five uniquely colored cylinders in a single vertical tower in the order of a predefined color gradient on a designated zone on the table.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'Cylinder Precision Stacking' and 'vertical_cylinder_alignment' which involve stacking cylinders in a specific order or alignment. However, the 'color-gradient-tower' task emphasizes a continuous gradient rather than just matching or ordering by size, adding a nuance that could be interesting for visual perception and decision-making. The language descriptions are clear and align with the task objectives. The simulation code appears to achieve the task goal by setting up the environment, defining the color gradient, and adding language goals for each step. However, the task's uniqueness might not be sufficient to warrant addition given the existing similar tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
