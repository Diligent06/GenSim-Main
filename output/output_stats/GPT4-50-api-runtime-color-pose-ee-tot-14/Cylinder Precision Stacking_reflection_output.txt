{'task-name': 'Cylinder Precision Stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack five different colored cylinders on top of each other in a specific color order on a marked zone on the tabletop, ensuring they do not topple over.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'color-coded-cylinder-placement' as it requires precise stacking in a specific order rather than just placement. It also introduces a vertical stacking challenge, which is different from the horizontal arrangement in 'color-coded-cylinder-placement'. However, the language descriptions in the simulation code are incorrect because they reference stacking the cylinder on top of another color, but the first cylinder is placed on the zone, not another cylinder. The code also lacks the implementation of the 'additional_reset' method and assumes the existence of a 'fill_template' method without definition.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
