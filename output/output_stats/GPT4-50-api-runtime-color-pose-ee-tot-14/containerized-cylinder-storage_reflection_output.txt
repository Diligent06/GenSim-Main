{'task-name': 'containerized-cylinder-storage', 'task-description': 'Arrange five differently colored cylinders into a single container, orienting them vertically and in ascending order of height without toppling.', 'assets-used': ['container/container-template.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the 'cylinder_sort_and_stack' and 'Cylinder Precision Stacking' tasks as it requires placing cylinders of varying heights in a container rather than stacking them. The vertical orientation and the requirement for ascending order of heights add a layer of complexity not covered by existing tasks. However, the simulation code provided does not enforce the ascending order of height within the container, which is a critical part of the task description. This oversight needs to be corrected for the task to achieve its goal and match the language description.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
