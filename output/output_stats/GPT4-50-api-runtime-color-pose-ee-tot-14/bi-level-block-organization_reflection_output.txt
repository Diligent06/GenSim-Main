{'task-name': 'bi-level-block-organization', 'task-description': 'Arrange four uniquely colored blocks on two different height stands, so each stand holds two blocks with matching colors.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/block.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks in the list. It combines elements of color matching and spatial organization across different heights, which is not covered by any single task currently listed. The language descriptions are clear and unambiguous, and the simulation code appears to correctly implement the intended task setup and goals. However, there might be a concern regarding the uniqueness of the task, as it has similarities with 'stack-block-pyramid' and 'color-coded-cylinder-placement'. The task could be more interesting if it involved additional complexity, such as varying the number of blocks or stands, or requiring a specific sequence of actions.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
