{'task-name': 'zone-block-segregation', 'task-description': 'Sort a mixture of differently colored blocks by placing each one on the matching colored zone on the tabletop, ensuring that the blocks do not overlap with each other within their designated zones.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is conceptually similar to 'cylinder_sort_stand' and 'precision_pallet_placement' which involve sorting objects by color into designated areas. However, it introduces a new element of ensuring that blocks do not overlap within their zones, adding an additional layer of complexity to the spatial reasoning required. Despite this, the task does not seem to offer a significant enough novelty or complexity to justify its addition to the current task list, as the core concept of color-based sorting is already well-represented.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
