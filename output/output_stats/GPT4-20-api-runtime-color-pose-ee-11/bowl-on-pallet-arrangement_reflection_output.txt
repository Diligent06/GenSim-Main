{'task-name': 'bowl-on-pallet-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of four bowls in specific colors on the corners of a pallet, ensuring each bowl is centered within a marked zone.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the other tasks in the list, as it involves precise placement of objects with specific colors in designated locations, which combines elements of sorting, precision, and spatial arrangement. However, the task may be too similar to 'precision-pallet-placement' and 'precision_pallet_placement', which also involve placing objects in the corners of a pallet. To ensure uniqueness, the task could be modified to include additional complexity or different objectives.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
