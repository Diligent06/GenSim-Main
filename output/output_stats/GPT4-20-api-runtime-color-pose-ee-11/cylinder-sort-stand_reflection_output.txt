{'task-name': 'cylinder-sort-stand', 'task-description': 'Sort cylinders of three different colors onto corresponding colored stands, ensuring each cylinder is placed upright on the center of the matching stand.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks such as 'cylinder-tower-balance' and 'cylinder_precision_stacking' as it involves sorting cylinders onto stands rather than stacking them. It also introduces a new challenge of aligning objects with corresponding colors, which is not covered by the current tasks. Moreover, the simulation code seems to correctly implement the task requirements and language descriptions, providing clear goals for object placement and using language templates to describe the task.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
