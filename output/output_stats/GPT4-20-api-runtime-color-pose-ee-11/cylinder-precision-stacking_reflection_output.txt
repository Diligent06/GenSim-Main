However, the simulation code does not check for the stability of the stack for a set duration, which is part of the task description. Additionally, the language descriptions are not fully realized in the code as they do not specify the order in which the cylinders should be stacked, which could lead to ambiguity during task execution.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
