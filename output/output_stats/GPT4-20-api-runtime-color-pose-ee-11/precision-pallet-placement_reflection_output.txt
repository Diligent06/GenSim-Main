{'task-name': 'precision-pallet-placement', 'task-description': 'Arrange four differently colored cylinders on a pallet, placing each one in a dedicated corner without any overlap between them.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the 'cylinder-tower-balance' and 'cylinder-precision-stacking' tasks as it focuses on precise placement in a 2D plane rather than stacking. It also introduces a spatial reasoning component by requiring the cylinders to be placed in specific corners, which is not covered by the current tasks. The simulation code correctly sets up the task environment with the necessary objects and defines clear language descriptions for the goals, which align with the task objective.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
