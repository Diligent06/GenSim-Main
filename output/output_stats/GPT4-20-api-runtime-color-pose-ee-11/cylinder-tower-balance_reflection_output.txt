{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-balance', 'task-description': 'Stack a specified number of colored cylinders into a vertical tower on top of a flat surface on the pallet, ensuring that the tower does not topple over.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks in the list as it specifically involves stacking cylindrical objects in a balanced vertical tower, which requires precision and stability in manipulation. This introduces unique challenges compared to the block stacking, kit assembling, or box palletizing tasks. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal of stacking cylinders and provides language descriptions for each step, which aligns with the task's objectives. However, the task's complexity and number of steps may need to be adjusted to ensure feasibility within the simulation environment.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
