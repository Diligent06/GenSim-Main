{'task-name': 'cylinder-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort cylinders of three different colors into three separate zones marked on the tabletop, with each zone corresponding to one cylinder color.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks in the list as it combines color matching with spatial sorting, which is not covered by any single task currently. Moreover, it provides an interesting challenge for visual perception in identifying colors, as well as the manipulation challenge of accurately placing objects within designated zones. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and the language descriptions are clear and unambiguous.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
