{'task-name': 'pallet-ring-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort differently colored cylinders onto corresponding colored zones on a pallet, creating separate stacks for each color.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-sorting' and 'cylinder_precision_stacking', but it combines elements of both. While it adds the complexity of stacking on a pallet, which is not present in 'cylinder-sorting', it does not significantly differ from 'cylinder_precision_stacking' which already involves precision stacking on a pallet. Furthermore, the task 'cylinder_ring_stack' involves stacking cylinders in a fixture with color matching, which is also similar in concept. The proposed task does not introduce a novel or sufficiently distinct challenge to warrant adding it to the task list.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
