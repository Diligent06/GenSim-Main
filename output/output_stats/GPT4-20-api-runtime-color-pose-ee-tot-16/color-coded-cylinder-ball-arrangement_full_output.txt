================= Task and Asset Design!

>>> Prompt: 
You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 

=========
Here are all the assets. Use only these assets in the task and code design.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}
- place-red-in-green: {'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the red blocks and place them into the green bowls amidst other objects.', 'task-name': 'place-red-in-green'}
- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}
- stack-block-pyramid: {'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'sequentially stack 6 blocks into a pyramid of 3-2-1 with rainbow colored ordering.', 'task-name': 'stack-block-pyramid'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-balance-beam",
 "task-description": "Balance a cylinder on top of a narrow stand without it falling off.",
 "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task is unique as it requires precise control of the robot to balance a cylindrical object on a narrow surface, which differs from stacking, inserting, or sorting tasks. It introduces a challenge of maintaining stability and equilibrium, which is a new aspect compared to previous tasks.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "color-coordinated-box-arrangement",
 "task-description": "Arrange multiple colored boxes in a pattern that matches the arrangement of colors displayed on a zone mat.",
 "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task involves pattern recognition and spatial arrangement of objects, where the robot must understand the arrangement of colors on a zone mat and replicate the pattern with colored boxes. It's a task that combines visual processing with manipulation, distinct from simple stacking or insertion.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "capsule-corner-placement",
 "task-description": "Place a cylinder vertically within each section of a corner-shaped marker, without any part of the cylinder touching the lines.",
 "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task introduces precision placement within constraints, as the robot has to ensure the cylinder is placed within a defined area without touching the boundary lines. It's different from direct stacking or aligning to a single point, as it requires understanding and respecting boundaries.

I choose **Task 2: color-coordinated-box-arrangement**.
Reason for choice: This task combines color recognition with spatial arrangement and introduces a novel aspect of visual pattern matching to tabletop manipulation tasks. It is also distinct from previous tasks which focused on object-specific manipulation (stacking, inserting, and aligning), whereas this task requires a broader understanding of color patterns and spatial layouts.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), training mode, six degrees of freedom (6DoF) setting, a pick-and-place primitive, and camera configurations. It also defines thresholds for position and rotation accuracy, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can generate perfect actions based on the current state of the environment.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering object symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-balance-beam" task, as they provide the necessary functions and variables to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables.

and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

``` 

In this code, we define a task called `CylinderBalanceBeam` where the goal is to balance a blue cylinder on top of a narrow stand. We use the `Suction` end-effector because we need to lift the cylinder along the Z-axis. We add the stand and the cylinder to the environment, ensuring that the cylinder's target pose is directly on top of the stand. We then define a single goal with a maximum reward of 1, as there is only one goal in this task. The `lang_template` is used to provide a language goal that corresponds to the motion goal.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{

    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-stack-challenge",
 "task-description": "Stack a series of three different colored cylinders in ascending height order on a designated zone.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task requires the robot to sort cylinders by height and carefully stack them to make a stable tower, testing the robot's perception and precision.

Task 2:
```
{
 "task-name": "bowl-ball-sorting",
 "task-description": "Sort five balls of distinct colors into five separate bowls, each matched to the color of the ball.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task combines color recognition with precise placement, where the robot must identify the color of each ball and place it into a bowl of the corresponding color.

Task 3:
```
{
 "task-name": "precision-insertion",
 "task-description": "Insert three small blocks into the corresponding cut-out shapes on a fixture, matching by shape and color.",
 "assets-used": ["insertion/fixture.urdf", "insertion/ell.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```
The task involves fine manipulation skills to insert the blocks into tight-fitting spots, resembling keyhole surgery or intricate assembly work.

Chosen Task: Task 3 - "precision-insertion"
The reason for choosing this task is that it combines shape matching with fine manipulation and color coordination, which introduces a higher complexity level not covered in the previous tasks. It challenges the robot's dexterity and requires excellent control to complete successfully. It is also significantly different from previous tasks that focused on stacking, aligning, and sorting by color alone, bringing a novel assembly-like dimension to the task set.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, a pick-and-place primitive, and camera configurations. It also sets evaluation thresholds for position and rotation, workspace bounds, and initializes variables for goals, language goals, progress, rewards, and asset root directory.

The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment, and it requires that the `assets_root` be set to locate the assets needed for the task.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. This is useful for creating demonstrations or for testing.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational differences.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal if available, or a default completion message.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file template and replace placeholders with actual values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation, specifying their URDF, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-stack-challenge" task, as they provide the necessary methods and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where three cylinders of different colors and sizes are to be stacked in ascending order of height on a designated zone. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the cylinders on the Z axis. The `zone_pose` is updated after each cylinder is added to account for the height of the stacked cylinders. The `add_goal` method is called with `step_max_reward` set to 1/3 for each cylinder since there are three goals in total.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-precision-stacking",
 "task-description": "Stack three different colored cylinders on top of each other in a specific color order on the stand, ensuring that they are centrally aligned for balance.",
 "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}
```

Task 2:
```
{
 "task-name": "ball-sorting-zone",
 "task-description": "Sort five colored balls into a corresponding colored bowl, with each bowl placed in separate zones on the tabletop.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

Task 3:
```
{
 "task-name": "insert-block-into-box",
 "task-description": "Insert a set of three blocks of different sizes into a box with compartments tailored to each block's size, matching the block colors with the compartment colors.",
 "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

I choose Task 2: "ball-sorting-zone".

The task "ball-sorting-zone" stands out as it combines the elements of color matching and precision placement within separate designated areas on the tabletop. It is also interesting due to the challenge of handling spherical objects, which can be more difficult to manipulate compared to blocks or cylinders due to their tendency to roll away. The aspect of sorting colored balls into the right colored bowl adds a layer of complexity in terms of both visual recognition and manipulative dexterity. The use of multiple zones introduces spatial awareness and planning, as the robot must navigate the tabletop to place each ball in the correct zone. This task does not overlap with previous tasks as it is not solely about stacking, insertion, or alignment, but rather about sorting and precise placement within multiple distinct areas, incorporating a color-matching aspect.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (training), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom for the robot. It also sets up a primitive for pick-and-place actions, camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task environment, setting up goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to calculate the actions needed to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the goals achieved.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or if a failure condition has been met.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, considering object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal or a completion message if all goals are achieved.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file and replace key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their pose and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target or multiple.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating if the goal is a pose or a zone.
- `params`: A list of parameters for zones if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions for the goal of the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-precision-stacking" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```
{
  "task-name": "balance-block-over-ball",
  "task-description": "Balance a block flat atop a ball without the block falling off.",
  "assets-used": ["stacking/block.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task involves delicate manipulation to place and balance a block on top of a ball. It introduces the challenge of maintaining stability on a curved surface.

Task 2:
```
{
  "task-name": "cylinder-tower",
  "task-description": "Stack three cylinders of different colors on top of each other in a specified order on a stand.",
  "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}
```
This task requires precision stacking of cylinders on a small stand, which adds the challenge of aligning objects with circular bases instead of squared bases as with blocks.

Task 3:
```
{
  "task-name": "pallet-jenga",
  "task-description": "Remove individual boxes from a precariously stacked tower on a pallet without causing the tower to collapse.",
  "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```
This task is like playing Jenga with a robot. It requires strategic removal of boxes while maintaining the stability of a complex structure.

I chose Task 2 - "cylinder-tower". The reason for my choice is that it introduces a new shape (cylinders) for stacking on a stand, as opposed to the typical block stacking, and it requires precision in both placement and balance. It is different from previous tasks that involve flat objects or predefined slots for inserting objects. This task involves open-ended stacking with cylindrical objects that are inherently more challenging to balance due to their curved surfaces.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with several attributes that define the task's properties and the environment's configuration.

- `ee`: The end effector used for the task, in this case, a suction gripper.
- `mode`: The mode of the task, which can be 'train' or 'test'.
- `sixdof`: A boolean indicating if the task allows six degrees of freedom.
- `primitive`: The action primitive used for the task, here it is `PickPlace`.
- `oracle_cams`: The camera configuration for the oracle (perfect knowledge) agent.
- `pos_eps` and `rot_eps`: Positional and rotational thresholds for determining if an object is correctly placed.
- `bounds`: The workspace bounds within which the task must be performed.
- `goals`: A list of subgoals for the task, each defined by an 8-tuple.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment.
- `oracle(env)`: Defines the oracle agent's behavior, which uses perfect knowledge to perform the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(...)`: Returns a random object size within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Colors an object with a random shade of brown.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of subgoals for the task, where each subgoal is an 8-tuple containing the following:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: The metric used to evaluate the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: Additional parameters for the task, such as zone targets and sizes.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions for the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing simulation code that interacts with the environment and defines tasks for the robotic agent to perform. The `self.goals` variable, in particular, is essential for tracking the progress and objectives of the task.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where a block must be balanced on top of a ball. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the block in the Z axis. The block and ball are added to the environment with random initial poses. The target pose for the block is set to be directly above the ball, with no rotation. The goal is added with a one-to-one correspondence between the block and the target pose, and the task is evaluated using the pose metric. The language goal provides a description of the task for the agent.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-sort-stand",
 "task-description": "Sort cylinders by color and stack them onto the corresponding colored stand without toppling the structure.",
 "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons: This task involves color recognition and precise stacking skills, which differs from simple placement or sweeping tasks. It requires the robot to balance objects carefully, adding complexity to the manipulation challenge.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-pyramid-assembly",
 "task-description": "Assemble a pyramid with balls by placing them in a bowl with a pyramid-shaped bottom, ensuring each ball settles in its designated spot.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons: This is a unique task requiring precision in placing balls that roll, which adds a dynamic aspect to manipulation and differs from static block stacking or insertion tasks.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "precision-box-zoning",
 "task-description": "Place a series of boxes of varying sizes into their corresponding zones without overlapping the zone boundaries.",
 "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons: This task combines spatial reasoning with precise control, as the robot has to accurately place objects of different dimensions within designated areas.

Chosen Task: Task 2

Reason for choice: Task 2, "ball-pyramid-assembly", stands out as it includes the challenge of dealing with rolling objects (balls) and placing them in a specifically structured bowl (with a pyramid-shaped bottom). This introduces a novel aspect of dynamic manipulation, where the robot must account for the movement of balls after placement, ensuring they settle correctly. It significantly differs from the other tasks that mostly involve static objects.

Now, the task description in natural language:

```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-pyramid-assembly",
 "task-description": "The robot's task is to create a pyramid structure using differently colored balls. Each ball must be carefully placed in a specially designed bowl that has indentations shaped like a pyramid base. The robot needs to ensure that each ball is placed into the correct indentation according to its color and that it remains settled in place without rolling away.",
 "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: A base class for defining a task in the simulation environment. It includes initialization of various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the primitive action (`primitive`), and the oracle cameras (`oracle_cams`). It also defines the workspace bounds, the evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), and the assets root directory (`assets_root`).

- `reset`: A method to reset the task environment, clearing goals and progress.

- `oracle`: A method that defines an oracle agent, which can provide an optimal action sequence for the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the actions needed to complete the task.

- `reward`: A method to calculate the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and goals.

- `done`: A method to check if the task is completed or has failed.

- `is_match`: A helper function to determine if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational differences.

- `get_random_pose`: A method to generate a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

- `get_lang_goal`: A method to get the current language goal or a completion message if all goals are completed.

- `get_reward`: A method to get the current cumulative reward.

- `fill_template`: A helper function to read a file and replace key strings with specified values.

- `get_random_size`: A method to generate a random size for an object within specified bounds.

- `color_random_brown`: A method to randomly color an object with a shade of brown.

- `add_object`: A method in the `Environment` class to add an object to the simulation environment, specifying its pose and whether it is fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following information:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each defined by a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric, either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for placing within a zone.
- `params`: A list of parameters relevant to the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-sort-stand" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

            target_pose = (stand_pose[0], (0, 0, stand_size[2] + cylinder_size[2] / 2))

            # Define the language goal
            language_goal = self.lang_template.format(color=color)

            # Add goal for the cylinder to be on the stand
            self.add_goal(objs=[cylinder_id], matches=np.ones((1, 1)), targ_poses=[target_pose], replace=False,
                          rotations=False, metric='pose', params=None, step_max_reward=1 / n_cylinders,
                          language_goal=language_goal)

        # Note: The task assumes that the push primitive is not needed as the suction end-effector is used to pick and place cylinders.
        # If the push primitive is needed for any reason, it can be used to adjust the cylinders' positions on the stands.
```

This code defines a task where cylinders must be sorted by color and stacked onto the corresponding colored stand. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick up the cylinders and place them onto the stands. Each cylinder and stand is assigned a color, and the goal is to match the cylinder color with the stand color. The target pose for each cylinder is calculated based on the stand's pose with an offset in the z-axis to account for the height of the cylinder. The `add_goal` method is used to define the sorting and stacking goals, with the language goal providing instructions for the task. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1 / n_cylinders` to distribute the reward evenly across all sorting and stacking actions.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."

reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and guidelines, here are three new task proposals:

**Task 1: Cylinder Tower Construction**
- **Task Description:**
Construct a tower by vertically stacking 4 cylinders of different colors on top of each other on a pallet, ensuring they don't topple over.
- **Assets Used:**
["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf"]
- **Task Name:**
"cylinder-tower-construction"

**Task 2: Ball Sorting Relay**
- **Task Description:**
Sort 5 differently colored balls into 5 separate zones, each zone corresponding to the color of one ball.
- **Assets Used:**
["ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
- **Task Name:**
"ball-sorting-relay"

**Task 3: Precision Placement on Stand**
- **Task Description:**
Place a green cylinder and a red block side by side on a narrow stand without knocking off either object.
- **Assets Used:**
["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
- **Task Name:**
"precision-placement-stand"

I choose **Task 3: Precision Placement on Stand** because it introduces the challenge of precise placement and balance, requiring fine motor control and stability beyond just stacking or sorting. It incorporates color differentiation and the necessity of maintaining the stability of multiple objects in close proximity on a narrow surface, which presents a unique difficulty not seen in previous tasks.

Here is the task described in a Python dictionary format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-placement-stand",
    "task-description": "Place a green cylinder and a red block side by side on a narrow stand without knocking off either object.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-sorting",
    "task-description": "Sort cylinders of three different colors into three separate zones marked on the tabletop, with each zone corresponding to one cylinder color.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "ball-and-bowl-challenge",
    "task-description": "Place a set of three different colored balls into a bowl without any ball rolling out, ensuring the bowl is not overfilled.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-tower-construction",
    "task-description": "Stack a specified number of boxes to create two separate towers on a single pallet, ensuring the towers are of equal height and stable.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

I chose Task 3, "pallet-tower-construction".

The selected task is the most distinct from the previously generated tasks as it involves creating two separate but equal towers on a single pallet, which adds a challenge in balance and precision. It combines elements of stacking and balancing, and the requirement for the towers to be of equal height adds to the complexity, making it a novel task. It is feasible as it obeys the laws of physics and is within the capabilities of tabletop manipulation.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes with default parameters such as end-effector type (`Suction`), mode (`train`), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`). It also sets up a pick-and-place primitive, camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task state and goals.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can generate actions to complete the task using perfect knowledge of the environment.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and goals.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering object symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal or a completion message if all goals are completed.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a URDF template with specific values and returns the path to the temporary file.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-sorting" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a `CylinderSorting` task where cylinders of different colors are sorted into corresponding color-coded zones. The task uses the `Suction` end-effector to pick and place the cylinders. Each cylinder and zone is added to the environment with a unique color and a random pose. The task goals are defined such that each cylinder must be placed in the zone with the matching color, and the reward is distributed equally among the three sorting actions.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and the guidance to create a novel, interesting, and feasible tabletop manipulation task that adheres to physics, here are three new task ideas:

**Task 1: Cylinder Precision Stacking**
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-precision-stacking",
 "task-description": "Stack a designated number of colored cylinders onto the smallest area of the pallet, challenging the robot's precision and stability control.",
 "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Uniqueness:* This task differs from previous stacking tasks because it requires the robot to stack cylindrical objects, which are more challenging due to their tendency to roll and the need for precise alignment. It also involves a restricted target area.

**Task 2: Ball Sorting Relay**
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-sorting-relay",
 "task-description": "Transfer colored balls from the tabletop to their corresponding colored zones marked on the tabletop without dropping them.",
 "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Uniqueness:* This task involves color recognition and careful manipulation to transfer balls without dropping them, which is distinct because it combines precision movement with color-based sorting.

**Task 3: Obstacle Box Arrangement**
```python
{
 "task-name": "obstacle-box-arrangement",
 "task-description": "Arrange a variety of differently sized boxes to form a staircase pattern around a central stand without knocking it over.",
 "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}
```
*Uniqueness:* The arrangement task requires spatial planning and delicate manipulation to create a specific structure without disturbing a central object, which is a unique combination of precision and strategic placement.

The chosen task is **Task 2: Ball Sorting Relay**.

This task is the most different from the previous ones because it introduces a relay-style challenge where the robot must move colored balls to matching colored zones. It combines the elements of color recognition, careful handling of spherical objects that can easily roll away, and precise placement. This task not only tests the robot's dexterity but also its ability to maintain control over objects that can roll. It is a feasible and physics-obeying task that requires a balance between speed and precision and involves no stacking, which has been a common theme in many of the previous tasks.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` method in the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks.
- It initializes with a suction end effector, a pick-and-place primitive, and default values for various task parameters.
- The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task environment.
- The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified tolerance.
- The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal.
- The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.
- Helper functions are provided for various tasks such as filling templates with data, generating random sizes, and changing object colors.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment, specifying their URDF, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

### self.goals Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task.
- Each tuple contains:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target or multiple.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
  - `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the evaluation metric for the task.
  - `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
  - `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for designing and implementing the "cylinder-precision-stacking" task. The task will involve creating a series of subgoals where the robot must pick up cylindrical objects and stack them precisely within a designated area on the pallet, adhering to the constraints of the workspace bounds and physics.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-precision-stacking".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must stack a designated number of colored cylinders onto a pallet. The `CylinderPrecisionStacking` class inherits from the `Task` class and uses the `Suction` end-effector to pick and stack the cylinders vertically. The task adds a pallet to the environment and then adds a series of colored cylinders. Each cylinder is assigned a target pose on top of the pallet, and a goal is added for each cylinder to be stacked. The `step_max_reward` is divided equally among the number of cylinders to encourage precision in stacking.

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
After reviewing the provided tasks and guidelines, here are three new robot simulation tabletop manipulation task ideas:

### Task 1: Precision Placement in a Grid 
- **Task-name**: "grid-precision-placement"
- **Task-description**: "Arrange colored cylinders in a 3x3 grid on the tabletop, matching the color of the cylinder with the color of the grid cell."
- **Assets-used**: ["zone/zone.obj", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

### Task 2: Sequential Bowl Stacking
- **Task-name**: "sequential-bowl-stacking"
- **Task-description**: "Stack bowls within each other in decreasing size order without toppling the stack."
- **Assets-used**: ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]

### Task 3: Heterogeneous Box Sorting
- **Task-name**: "heterogeneous-box-sorting"
- **Task-description**: "Sort boxes of varying sizes into three separate zones on the tabletop, with each zone designated by a different colored line."
- **Assets-used**: ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]

Out of these three tasks, I choose **Task 3: Heterogeneous Box Sorting**. This task is the most different because it incorporates elements of sorting by size (heterogeneous boxes), spatial organization (placement in zones), and color matching (identifying zones by colored lines). It also requires the robot to handle objects of varying dimensions, challenges its spatial reasoning, and demands precise placement, which are not explicitly addressed in the previous tasks.

Now, here's the description in the required dictionary format:

```python
{
  "task-name": "heterogeneous-box-sorting",
  "task-description": "Sort boxes of varying sizes into three separate zones on the tabletop, each designated by a different colored line.",
  "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
 "task-name": "cylinder-ring-stack",
 "task-description": "Stack a series of differently colored cylinders inside a fixture with concentric rings, matching the cylinder colors to the corresponding colored rings.",
 "assets-used": ["insertion/fixture.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons for choice: This task introduces a new element of precision by requiring the robot to place objects within a confined space that has a specific order. The concentric rings add an extra layer of complexity, as the robot must align the cylinders accurately.

Task 2:
```python
{
 "task-name": "ball-sorting-precision",
 "task-description": "Sort colored balls into separate color-coded zones on a pallet, with each zone only having enough space for one ball.",
 "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons for choice: This task combines color recognition with precise spatial allocation. The limited space in each zone requires careful manipulation to ensure each ball is placed accurately without disturbing adjacent balls.

Task 3:
```python
{
 "task-name": "asymmetric-block-balancing",
 "task-description": "Balance an L-shaped block on the narrow edge of a stand, ensuring the block does not topple over.",
 "assets-used": ["stacking/stand.urdf", "insertion/ell.urdf"]
}
```
Reasons for choice: This task is a test of stability and fine motor control, as the robot must delicately place the L-shaped block in a position that is not naturally stable.

**I chose Task 1: "cylinder-ring-stack".**

The reason for my choice is that Task 1 presents a novel challenge that has not been previously generated. It requires a combination of color matching, precision in placing objects within a constrained area, and the ability to deal with varying sizes and positions due to the concentric rings. This task stands out because it not only tests the robot's precision and dexterity but also its ability to sequence the placement of objects based on color, adding an extra decision-making layer to the task.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: This is the base class for tasks, which includes initialization of various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), training mode (`mode`), six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the pick and place primitive (`primitive`). It also defines the workspace bounds, evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), and the assets root directory.

- `reset`: This method resets the task, clearing goals and progress.

- `oracle`: This method provides an oracle agent that can generate perfect actions based on the current state of the environment. It uses perfect RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to determine the actions.

- `reward`: This method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.

- `done`: This method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

- `is_match`: This helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

- `get_random_pose`: This method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

- `get_lang_goal`: This method returns the current language goal.

- `get_reward`: This method returns the current cumulative reward.

- `fill_template`: This helper function reads a file template and replaces key strings with specified values.

- `get_random_size`: This method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

- `color_random_brown`: This method assigns a random brown color to an object.

- `add_object`: This method adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether each object can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-ring-stack" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the environment, control the robot, and evaluate its performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

In this code, we define a task called `CylinderRingStack` which inherits from the `Task` class. The task involves stacking colored cylinders into corresponding colored rings on a fixture. We use the `Suction` end-effector since we need to move objects along the Z-axis. We set the maximum number of steps to 4, anticipating that stacking two cylinders will require two steps each.

We add a fixture to the environment and then add two cylinders, one red and one green. We generate a random pose for each cylinder and set their colors using the `utils.COLORS` dictionary. We use the `fill_template` function to replace placeholders in the URDF template with actual values, and then add the cylinders to the environment.

For each cylinder, we add a goal that specifies the cylinder should be placed in the ring with the matching color. The `add_goal` function is called with parameters that define the objects involved, the matching condition, the target poses, and the language goal that describes the task. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1 / len(cylinder_colors)` to distribute the reward evenly across the number of cylinders.

The target poses for the cylinders are assumed to be the same as the fixture pose, which implies that the fixture is designed with concentric rings that can hold the cylinders at that pose. If the rings have different target poses, these would need to be specified in the `targ_poses` parameter.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.
- The form of the task you generate must be the same as the example given to you above.





>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "color-coded-container-segregation",
    "task-description": "Segregate colored cylinders into matching colored containers based on the colored zones they are placed in.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task introduces a color matching challenge that requires both object recognition and precise placement skills. It extends the sorting task concept into a three-dimensional structure by using containers instead of flat zones.

Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-tower-construction",
    "task-description": "Construct a tower by vertically stacking different colored boxes on a pallet while maintaining a predefined color sequence.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: Building a vertical structure adds a stability challenge to the manipulation task, which tests the robot's ability to balance objects and deal with potential toppling.

Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "ball-bowl-categorization",
    "task-description": "Sort balls into bowls based on their colors, with each bowl designated for a specific color located in different zones on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
Reason: This task combines color sorting with spatial awareness as the robot needs to recognize the correct zone for each colored bowl and place the corresponding colored ball inside it.

The chosen task is Task 3: "ball-bowl-categorization".

Reason for choice: Compared to the previously generated tasks, "ball-bowl-categorization" is more novel because it incorporates a clear color matching challenge with spatial segregation, which is different from merely stacking or inserting objects. It necessitates the robot to recognize colors, manage gentle placement into bowls, and understand the layout of the zones. This combination of requirements makes for a unique task that stands out in complexity and diversity.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and initializes task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can calculate the optimal action based on perfect knowledge of the environment.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals, and checks if the task is complete.
- **Done**: Checks if the task has been completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Provides functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes, and apply random colors to objects.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### `self.goals` Variable:
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targ_poses)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, each represented as a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether an object can match with multiple targets (`True`) or if it should match with a unique target (`False`).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, either by matching object poses (`pose`) or by measuring object intersection with a zone (`zone`).
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: If the metric is `zone`, this is a list of tuples, each containing a zone target pose and zone size.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A string containing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current subgoal.

Understanding these components is crucial for implementing the "color-coded-container-segregation" task, as they provide the necessary framework for defining the task logic, goals, and reward structure within the simulation environment.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-container-segregation".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where cylinders of different colors must be placed into containers with matching colors. The task uses zones to indicate where the cylinders should be placed, and the goal is to match the color of the cylinder with the color of the container. The task is designed to be completed using a suction end-effector, which is suitable for picking up and placing the cylindrical objects. The `max_steps` is set to twice the number of expected `add_goal` calls to allow for some flexibility in the task execution.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.


Please generate at least 3 different tasks and choose the one that you think is the most different from the ones you have already generated before, and describe the reasons for your choice.
Please tell me in a separate line of output which task you chose, e.g. Task 1, Task 2, etc.
=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.
- The form of the task you generate must be the same as the example given to you above.





>>> Answer: 
Here are three diverse tabletop manipulation tasks:

**Task 1: Color-Coded Cylinder and Ball Arrangement**
```python
{
    "task-name": "color-coded-cylinder-ball-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange colored cylinders and balls in alternating order by color in a designated zone on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges:*
This task involves recognizing and alternating between different object types (cylinders and balls) while also considering their colors. The challenge lies in the manipulation of two different shapes, which requires different grasping strategies, and the additional cognitive load of color-based sorting.

**Task 2: Sequential Box Opening**
```python
{
    "task-name": "sequential-box-opening",
    "task-description": "Open a series of boxes by removing their lids and then placing them inside each other based on size, from largest to smallest.",
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges:*
The task introduces the concept of object manipulation through opening, which requires precision and careful control. Additionally, nesting the boxes based on size tests the robot's ability to assess dimensions and perform a sequence of actions.

**Task 3: Precision Ball Placement on Pallet**
```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-ball-placement-pallet",
    "task-description": "Place colored balls on a pallet, aligning them in precise rows and columns without knocking any off.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```
*Novelty and Challenges:*
This task tests precision manipulation and spatial planning, as the robot must place balls with care to avoid collisions and ensure they stay within the bounds of the pallet. It combines delicate handling with strategic arrangement.

**Choice**
I choose Task 3: Precision Ball Placement on Pallet.

*Reasons for the choice:*
- This task involves precise manipulation and careful planning, distinguishing it from tasks that involve stacking or inserting.
- The alignment of balls in rows and columns on a flat surface is a new challenge that has not been addressed in previous tasks.
- It requires fine control to place the balls without disturbing others, adding an element of difficulty.
- The use of only balls and a pallet differs from other tasks that mix object types or require color matching, offering a distinct task setup.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the pick and place primitive (`primitive`), and the oracle cameras configuration (`oracle_cams`). It also sets evaluation thresholds for position and rotation (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle(env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and metrics.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Determines if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Retrieves the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with one unique target or multiple targets.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "color-coded-cylinder-ball-arrangement" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the environment, define goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must arrange colored cylinders and balls in alternating order by color in a designated zone on the tabletop. The `ColorCodedCylinderBallArrangement` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the environment, including the zone and the objects to be arranged. The `reset` method is responsible for adding the zone and the objects to the environment, defining their sizes and colors, and setting the target poses for the arrangement. The `add_goal` method is called for each object to define the task's goals, including the language goals that describe the task in natural language. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick and place objects in 3D space, and the `max_steps` parameter is set to allow for a sufficient number of actions to complete the task.
