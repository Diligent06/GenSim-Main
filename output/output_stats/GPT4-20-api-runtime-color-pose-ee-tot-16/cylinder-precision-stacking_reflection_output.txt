{'task-name': 'cylinder-precision-stacking', 'task-description': "Stack a designated number of colored cylinders onto the smallest area of the pallet, challenging the robot's precision and stability control.", 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the task appears to be a variation of 'cylinder-balance-beam' and 'cylinder-sorting', it introduces a unique precision-stacking challenge that is not covered by the current tasks. It requires the robot to stack cylinders vertically in a limited space, testing both precision and stability which are critical for robotic manipulation. Additionally, the language descriptions align with the goals of the task, providing clear instructions for stacking each colored cylinder.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
