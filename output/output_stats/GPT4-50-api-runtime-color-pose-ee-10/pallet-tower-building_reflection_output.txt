{'task-name': 'pallet-tower-building', 'task-description': 'Construct a tower by vertically stacking differently colored cylinders on top of each other on a single pallet, ensuring the tower remains stable and upright.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the current task list as it focuses on vertical stacking for stability, which is not covered by the other tasks. It also introduces the challenge of maintaining the tower's stability, which adds an interesting dynamic to the task. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, generating random positions for the cylinders, defining target poses based on the pallet's position, and providing language instructions for each step of the task. However, the code could be improved by ensuring that the target poses for the cylinders are correctly calculated to stack them vertically on top of each other.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
