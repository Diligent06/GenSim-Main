{'task-name': 'cylinder-bowl-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of five differently colored cylinders by inserting them vertically into corresponding colored bowls, ensuring that the cylinder does not topple over.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the task concept is clear and the simulation code sets up the task environment correctly, it is quite similar to the existing 'cylinder-color-matching' and 'color-coded-container-arrangement' tasks. The main difference lies in the use of bowls instead of zones or containers and the additional challenge of preventing the cylinders from toppling. However, this may not be enough to warrant a new task as the core concept of matching colors and placing objects upright is already covered.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
