{'task-name': 'stack-cylinders-on-pallet', 'task-description': 'Stack a set of five different colored cylinders on top of each other in a specific color order on a pallet, ensuring stability and precise alignment.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is very similar to 'pallet_tower_building' which involves stacking cylinders on a pallet. The primary difference is the specific color order requirement, which adds a slight variation but may not be sufficient to consider it a unique task. Additionally, the simulation code provided does not handle the stability of the stack, which is a key part of the task description. The language descriptions are clear but do not add significant novelty compared to existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
