{'task-name': 'cylinder-pallet-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort colored cylinders by placing them into designated zones on a pallet, with each zone corresponding to a specific color of the cylinders.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from 'cylinder_sort_stand' and 'cylinder_color_matching' as it involves sorting cylinders onto a pallet, which adds a layer of complexity in object placement. However, it is similar to 'pallet_tower_building' but without the stacking element. The simulation code does achieve the goal and provides clear language descriptions for the task, which is beneficial for language-conditioned policy learning.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
