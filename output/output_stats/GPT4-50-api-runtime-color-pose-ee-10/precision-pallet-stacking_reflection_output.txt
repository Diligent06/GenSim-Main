{'task-name': 'precision-pallet-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack a sequence of five differently colored blocks onto a single pallet, alternating the orientation of each block by 90 degrees to form a stable, interlocked structure.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'palletizing-boxes' and 'pallet-tower-building' as it introduces the complexity of alternating block orientations which requires precise manipulation and planning. Additionally, the task involves a sequence of actions that must be performed in a specific order and orientation, adding to its complexity. The language descriptions are clear and directly correspond to the actions required to complete the task. The simulation code appears to correctly instantiate the task environment, add the necessary objects, define the goals, and provide language instructions for each step. However, the code might need to be tested in the simulation environment to confirm that it functions as intended.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
