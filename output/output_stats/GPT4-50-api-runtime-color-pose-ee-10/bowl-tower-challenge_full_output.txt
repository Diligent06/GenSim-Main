================= Task and Asset Design!

>>> Prompt: 
You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 

=========
Here are all the assets. Use only these assets in the task and code design.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}
- place-red-in-green: {'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the red blocks and place them into the green bowls amidst other objects.', 'task-name': 'place-red-in-green'}
- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}
- stack-block-pyramid: {'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'sequentially stack 6 blocks into a pyramid of 3-2-1 with rainbow colored ordering.', 'task-name': 'stack-block-pyramid'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and guidelines, here is a new task described in natural language:

Task Name: "cylinder-sort-stand"

Task Description: "Sort colored cylinders by placing them onto matching colored stands within a defined zone, testing the robot's precision and object recognition capabilities."

Assets Used: ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

This task is novel because it combines elements of color matching with precision placement, which requires the robot to not only identify the correct color of the cylinder and stand but also to carefully position the cylinder onto the stand without knocking it over. The challenge stems from the precise manipulation needed to ensure the cylinder is balanced on the stand and the complexity of distinguishing between multiple colors.

The task in Python dictionary format would be:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-sort-stand",
    "task-description": "Sort colored cylinders by placing them onto matching colored stands within a defined zone, testing the robot's precision and object recognition capabilities.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment, initializing goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses different metrics such as 'pose' and 'zone' to evaluate the success of the actions taken by the agent.

The `done` method checks if the task has been completed or if a failure condition has been met.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, taking into account object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal or a task completion description if all language goals have been achieved.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method reads a URDF file template and replaces placeholders with specific values to generate a URDF file for an object.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, the target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the evaluation metric, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the step, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides a textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "cylinder-sort-stand" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-sort-stand".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must sort colored cylinders by placing them onto matching colored stands within a defined zone. The task uses suction as the end-effector to move the cylinders vertically onto the stands. The `reset` method adds a goal zone, cylinders, and stands to the environment, and defines goals for placing each cylinder on a stand with the same color. The `add_goal` method is called with the appropriate parameters to set the goals for the task, including the language goal for each action. The `max_steps` is set to twice the number of cylinders to allow for enough steps to complete the task.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines provided and the assets available, here's a description of a new task:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-cylinder-stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack a specific number of colored cylinders into a bowl without toppling them, testing the robot's precision and stability control.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

This task is novel as it involves stacking objects (cylinders) of a specific shape into another object (a bowl) which has an inherent instability due to the curved shape of the bowl. The challenge lies in carefully placing each cylinder to avoid knocking over the existing stack, requiring a high level of precision and control. The task also involves the challenge of object recognition (differentiating cylinder colors) and spatial reasoning (understanding and planning the stack within the confines of the bowl).

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, primitive actions, camera configurations, and workspace bounds.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and goals.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the current state.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Includes functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes for objects, and apply random colors.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### `self.goals` Variable:
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, each defined by a translation (x, y, z) and a rotation quaternion (q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can match with multiple targets (`True`) or if they must match uniquely (`False`).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, either by matching poses or by placing objects within a specified zone.
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A string providing a low-level language instruction describing the goal of the current step.

The task's success is determined by the agent's ability to match objects to their target poses or zones according to the specified goals, while adhering to the constraints of the environment, such as avoiding collisions and staying within the workspace bounds. The reward function and completion check are based on the progress made towards these goals.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must stack a random number of red cylinders into a brown bowl. The `BowlCylinderStacking` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment by adding a bowl and a specific number of cylinders to the environment. The cylinders are to be stacked in the bowl, and the goal is defined accordingly. The `Suction` end-effector is used for precise vertical stacking. The target pose for the cylinders is based on the bowl's pose, and the `add_goal` method is used to define the task's objective. The language template provides a description of the task for language-conditioned policies.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a description of a new robot simulation task that adheres to the provided constraints and guidelines:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-cylinder-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of colored cylinders in a specific pattern inside a large bowl without any overlap between the cylinders, testing the robot's dexterity and spatial reasoning.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

### Novelty and Challenges:

- **Novelty**: This task requires arranging multiple objects (cylinders) inside a container (bowl) in a specified pattern. It differs from stacking or simply placing objects in a bowl as it requires precise control to avoid overlaps and maintain the pattern.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Dexterity**: The robot must manipulate the cylinders with precision to arrange them without causing them to fall over or touch each other.
  - **Spatial Reasoning**: The task tests the robot's ability to reason about space and to plan the placement of the cylinders to fit the given pattern.
  - **Color Recognition**: If the cylinders are colored, the robot would need to identify the colors and place them accordingly to match the pattern.
  - **Pattern Formation**: The task may involve complex patterns which require advanced planning and sequencing of movements.
  - **Collision Avoidance**: Ensuring that the cylinders do not collide with each other or the sides of the bowl adds to the complexity of the task.

The task remains physically feasible and adheres to the principles of physics, as it involves picking, placing, and arranging solid objects within a defined space.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:

- **Initialization**: The constructor initializes various attributes such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation, whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the primitive used for manipulation, and the camera configuration.
- **Reset**: The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment. It initializes goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.
- **Oracle**: The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can calculate the optimal action based on perfect knowledge of the environment.
- **Reward**: The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- **Done**: The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: These include methods like `is_match` to check if two poses match within a threshold, `get_random_pose` to get a random collision-free pose, and `get_lang_goal` to get the current language goal.
- **Helper Functions**: These include utility functions like `fill_template` to read and replace strings in a file, `get_random_size` to get a random object size, and `color_random_brown` to change the color of an object.

### The `self.goals` Variable:

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches**: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses. The dimensions of the matrix are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses**: A list of target poses, where each pose is a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace**: A boolean indicating whether each object can match with only one unique target (`False`) or multiple targets (`True`).
5. **rotations**: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
6. **metric**: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the subgoal, which can be either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for placing within a general area.
7. **params**: A list of parameters relevant to the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
8. **step_max_reward**: A float representing the total reward for completing the subgoal, independent of the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

### Environment Class:

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the URDF file path, the pose of the object, and the category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments and returns the object ID.

The objects in the task must obey physics and avoid collisions. The goal poses for the objects must be within the specified workspace bounds, and the task involves multiple subgoals that the agent must complete using pick-and-place primitives.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

- stack-block-pyramid: {'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'sequentially stack 6 blocks into a pyramid of 3-2-1 with rainbow colored ordering.', 'task-name': 'stack-block-pyramid'}
- palletizing-boxes: {'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'box/box-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up homogeneous fixed-sized boxes and stack them in transposed layers on the pallet.', 'task-name': 'palletizing-boxes'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is the description of a new tabletop manipulation task that adheres to the provided guidelines and leverages the available assets:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-placement-sequence",
    "task-description": "Arrange a sequence of colored cylinders on matching colored zones on the tabletop, following a specific order from smallest to largest diameter.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of Novelty and Challenges:
- This task introduces the challenge of size discrimination in addition to color matching, requiring the robot to recognize and handle cylinders of different diameters.
- The task requires sequential task completion, with the robot needing to place the cylinders in a predefined order, enhancing its planning capabilities.
- As the cylinders vary in size, the grasping and placement strategy will need to adapt to each cylinder's diameter, testing the robot's manipulation skills.
- The use of colored zones adds to the complexity by requiring the robot to not only identify the correct cylinder but also the corresponding colored zone on the tabletop.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` method for the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, a pick-and-place primitive, and oracle camera configurations. It also sets up evaluation metrics for pose accuracy, workspace bounds, and initializes variables for goals, language goals, progress, rewards, and the assets root directory.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task, clearing goals and progress. The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment, which is useful for demonstrations or testing.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses either pose matching or zone intersection to evaluate the task's progress.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, which is determined by whether all goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, taking into account any symmetries of the object around the z-axis.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal, and `get_reward` returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility for reading a URDF file template and replacing placeholders with specific values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds, and `color_random_brown` applies a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation, specifying their URDF file, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved in the subgoal, how they match with target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the evaluation metric, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the subgoal, and the symmetries of the objects.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for implementing the "cylinder-placement-sequence" task, as it will involve defining the goals, setting up the environment, and calculating rewards based on the task's objectives.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-placement-sequence".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables.

"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines provided and the assets available, here is a new task designed for tabletop manipulation:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-color-matching",
    "task-description": "Arrange cylinders of varying colors onto correspondingly colored zones within a defined area, testing the robot's ability to discriminate between colors and precisely place objects.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

**Novelty:** This task introduces the challenge of color recognition and matching, requiring the robot to identify each cylinder's color and place it in the appropriately colored zone. The task's complexity can be adjusted by varying the number of cylinders and zones as well as the shades of colors used.

**Challenges:** The task requires precision in placement to ensure that each cylinder is correctly positioned within its target zone. Additionally, color discrimination is crucial, which can be challenging if the colors of the cylinders and zones are similar or if lighting conditions affect color perception. The task also tests the robot's ability to handle cylindrical objects, which may roll if not manipulated carefully.

**Feasibility:** Since the task only involves picking and placing objects that obey the laws of physics and are within the robot's capability, it remains a feasible tabletop manipulation task.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` function in the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks.
- It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, a pick-and-place primitive, and camera configurations.
- The `reset` method is used to reset the task state.
- The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the current state.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified tolerance.
- The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- The `get_lang_goal` method retrieves the current language goal.
- The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.
- The `fill_template` method is a utility to fill a URDF template with specific values.
- The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task.
- Each tuple contains:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects match which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
  - `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
  - `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
  - `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions for the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for writing the code for the "cylinder-color-matching" task. The task will involve creating instances of cylinders, defining their target zones based on color, and setting up the subgoals for the robot to execute the task. The robot will need to pick up cylinders and place them in the matching color zones, with the task's success being measured by the robot's ability to correctly match colors and place objects within the specified bounds.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-color-matching".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must arrange cylinders of varying colors onto correspondingly colored zones. The task uses suction as the end-effector to move the cylinders vertically. Each cylinder has a corresponding zone with a matching color, and the robot's goal is to place each cylinder in its respective zone. The `max_steps` is set to twice the number of goals to provide enough steps for the robot to complete the task. The `lang_template` provides a language goal for each action, guiding the robot to place the cylinders correctly. The `add_goal` function is used to define the desired end state for each cylinder, with a `step_max_reward` of 1 for each correctly placed cylinder.

For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-tower-building",
    "task-description": "Construct a tower by vertically stacking differently colored cylinders on top of each other on a single pallet, ensuring the tower remains stable and upright.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation:

The novelty of this task lies in its requirement for precise vertical stacking of objects (cylinders) instead of horizontal layering or sorting. It introduces the challenge of maintaining balance and stability as the tower height increases. This task requires the robot to have a good control strategy to carefully place each cylinder while avoiding knocking over the tower, thus testing the robot's steadiness and precision in manipulation.

Challenges:

1. **Precision Placement**: Each cylinder must be aligned and centered accurately on top of the previous one.
2. **Color Variation**: If cylinders come in different colors, the robot might need to follow a specific sequence based on color, adding to the complexity.
3. **Balance and Stability**: As the tower grows taller, the risk of it toppling over increases.
4. **Height Sensing**: The robot needs to detect the height of the stack to place the next cylinder correctly.
5. **Manipulation Control**: Smooth and controlled movements are essential to prevent disturbing the already placed cylinders.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task.
- It initializes various parameters such as end effector type (`ee`), training mode (`mode`), six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the pick-and-place primitive (`primitive`).
- It defines workspace bounds, evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), and the assets root directory.
- The `reset` method is used to reset the task state.
- The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- Helper functions like `is_match`, `get_random_pose`, and `fill_template` are used to support task execution.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment, specifying their URDF, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target or any target.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
  - `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
  - `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
  - `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the goal of the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "pallet-tower-building" task. The task will involve creating a stable tower by stacking cylinders on a pallet, which will require precise control and stability to ensure the tower does not topple. The `self.goals` variable will be particularly important for defining the subgoals of placing each cylinder at the correct position and orientation on top of the previous one.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "pallet-tower-building".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],

reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",

reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and assets provided, here's a new task described in natural language:

Task Name: "Cylinder Pallet Sorting"

Task Description: "Sort colored cylinders by placing them into designated zones on a pallet, with each zone corresponding to a specific color of the cylinders."

Assets Used: ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]

Novelty and Challenges:
- This task involves both color recognition and precise placement, challenging the robot's vision system and control accuracy.
- The task requires the robot to distinguish between different zones on a single pallet, adding complexity to the spatial reasoning required.
- Sorting tasks are inherently interesting due to the need for decision-making and the clear visual change in the environment as the task progresses.

Python dictionary format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-pallet-sorting",
    "task-description": "Sort colored cylinders by placing them into designated zones on a pallet, with each zone corresponding to a specific color of the cylinders.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and initializes task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and language goals.
- **Oracle Agent**: Provides an oracle (perfect) agent that can perform the task without errors, used for demonstrations or testing.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals, using either pose matching or zone intersection metrics.
- **Task Completion**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check pose matching, get random poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Provides functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes, and color objects.

### `self.goals` Variable:
- **objs (List of obj_id)**: Contains object IDs that are involved in the task.
- **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: Specifies the target poses for the objects, each pose being a tuple of translation and rotation.
- **replace (Boolean)**: Determines if objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- **rotations (Boolean)**: Indicates if the placement action includes a rotational component.
- **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, either by matching poses or by placing objects within a zone.
- **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
- **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing a step in the task, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- **symmetries**: Specifies the symmetry of the objects around the z-axis in radians.
- **language_goal**: Provides a low-level language instruction that describes the goal of the current step.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The task "Cylinder Pallet Sorting" will require the implementation of these components to define the task logic, including setting up the environment, defining the goals, and calculating rewards based on the task's objectives. The task will involve recognizing the color of cylinders, picking them up, and placing them in the correct zones on a pallet according to their colors, while ensuring that the objects obey physics and do not collide with each other.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-pallet-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where colored cylinders must be sorted into corresponding colored zones on a pallet. The task uses a Suction end-effector to pick up the cylinders and place them into the zones. Each cylinder and zone has a designated color, and the goal is to match each cylinder with the zone of the same color. The `add_goal` method is used to define the desired final state for each cylinder, and the `lang_template` provides a language instruction for each step of the task. The cylinders are shuffled to ensure that the task varies in each run.

=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the assets provided and the guidelines to ensure novelty and avoid overlap with existing tasks, here is a new task described in natural language:

Task Name: "Zone Cylinder Sorting"

Task Description: Arrange a series of differently colored cylinders on a marked zone on the tabletop by matching each cylinder's color with the corresponding colored area within the zone.

Assets Used: ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

This task is novel because it incorporates color matching and spatial arrangement within a defined zone, which tests the robot's ability to recognize colors and precisely place objects in specific locations. The challenge lies in the robot's vision system to accurately identify colors and the manipulation system to control the placement within the constrained space of the colored areas. Additionally, the task's feasibility is ensured by the use of simple pick-and-place actions that obey the laws of physics and are achievable within a tabletop manipulation scenario.

Here's the task formatted as a Python dictionary:

```python
{
    "task-name": "zone-cylinder-sorting",
    "task-description": "Arrange a series of differently colored cylinders on a marked zone on the tabletop by matching each cylinder's color with the corresponding colored area within the zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick-and-place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, initializing goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can calculate the optimal action based on the current state of the environment. It uses perfect RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to determine the next best action.

The `reward` method calculates the delta rewards for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the metric used to evaluate the task's progress (either 'pose' or 'zone').

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, based on whether all goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, taking into account any symmetries around the z-axis.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method reads a URDF file template and replaces placeholders with specific values to generate a temporary file with a unique name.

The `get_random_size` method returns a random size for an object within specified minimum and maximum dimensions.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation DoF.
- `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the type of goal metric.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the goal of the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "zone-cylinder-sorting" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must sort differently colored cylinders into corresponding colored areas within a zone. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick up the cylinders. The zone and cylinders are added to the environment with random poses, and goals are defined for each cylinder to be placed in the correct area within the zone. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1/n_cylinders` to distribute the reward evenly across all cylinders. The target poses within the zone are not explicitly calculated in this example, but in a real scenario, you would calculate specific positions for each cylinder based on its color.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task description based on the provided guidelines and avoiding overlap with existing tasks:

```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-block-sorting",
    "task-description": "Sort and place a set of differently colored blocks into corresponding colored zones within a container, ensuring that each block is within its designated area without stacking.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

This task is novel because it combines the challenges of color recognition, precise placement, and spatial reasoning within a confined area (the container), without the added complexity of stacking. It requires the robot to distinguish between colors of the blocks and the corresponding colored zones, and carefully place each block such that it fits into the designated zone. The task is complex enough to challenge a robot's manipulation capabilities but remains physically feasible as it obeys the physics of non-overlapping placement within a confined space.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the task requirements for "precision-block-sorting". Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), training mode, six degrees of freedom (6DoF) settings, pick and place primitives, and camera configurations. It also sets evaluation thresholds for position and rotation, workspace bounds, and initializes variables for goals, language goals, progress, rewards, and asset root directory.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, and the `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly for demonstration or testing purposes.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It can evaluate based on object poses or zones, depending on the metric specified in the goals.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, which is used to determine the success of an episode.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors, as well as object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal, and `get_reward` returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility for reading a file template and replacing key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for a box within specified bounds, and `color_random_brown` applies a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, the matches between objects and target poses, whether objects can match with multiple targets, whether rotations are considered, the metric for evaluation, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the step, and the symmetries of the objects.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the simulation code for the "precision-block-sorting" task, ensuring that the robot can identify the colored blocks, sort them, and place them into the corresponding colored zones within the container without stacking and while obeying the physics constraints of the simulation environment.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "precision-block-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where a robot must sort differently colored blocks into corresponding colored zones within a container. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick and place the blocks. Each block has a designated zone with a matching color, and the robot receives a reward for placing each block in the correct zone. The task is described using language goals that match the motion goals, ensuring that the robot understands the task both linguistically and spatially.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{

    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task described in natural language, explaining its novelty and challenges:

```python
{
    "task-name": "container-block-sequence",
    "task-description": "Arrange a sequence of differently colored blocks within a container, placing them in a specific order from left to right following a given color pattern.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty: This task combines the challenge of precise object placement with the cognitive task of pattern recognition and sequence creation. Unlike simple sorting or stacking, the robot must interpret a predefined color sequence and place the objects according to that sequence within the constraints of the container.

Challenges: 
- Spatial reasoning to fit the blocks in a left-to-right sequence within the confined space of the container.
- Recognizing and remembering the specified color order.
- Manipulating the blocks with accuracy to align them properly without disturbing the already placed blocks.
- The task requires delicacy to prevent the blocks from tipping over or misaligning as the container fills up.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the pick and place primitive (`primitive`), and the oracle cameras configuration (`oracle_cams`). It also defines evaluation metrics (`pos_eps`, `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle(env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and goals.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Retrieves the current language goal or a completion message if all goals are met.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the cumulative reward for the task.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether each object can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "container-block-sequence" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where a sequence of colored blocks must be arranged within a container. The `ContainerBlockSequence` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment, including the container and blocks. The blocks must be placed in a specific order from left to right, following the color sequence defined in `color_sequence`. The `reset` method adds the container and blocks to the environment, generates random poses for the blocks, and defines their target poses within the container. The `add_goal` method is used to add goals for each block, specifying the target pose and language goal for the placement. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick and place the blocks, and the `max_steps` parameter is set to allow for a sufficient number of actions to complete the task.

For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- cylinder_pallet_sorting: {'task-name': 'cylinder-pallet-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort colored cylinders by placing them into designated zones on a pallet, with each zone corresponding to a specific color of the cylinders.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf']}
- place-red-in-green: {'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the red blocks and place them into the green bowls amidst other objects.', 'task-name': 'place-red-in-green'}
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}
- assembling-kits: {'assets-used': ['kitting/kit.urdf', 'kitting/object-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up different objects and arrange them on a board marked with corresponding silhouettes.', 'task-name': 'assembling-kits'}
- pallet_tower_building: {'task-name': 'pallet-tower-building', 'task-description': 'Construct a tower by vertically stacking differently colored cylinders on top of each other on a single pallet, ensuring the tower remains stable and upright.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf']}
- manipulating-rope: {'assets-used': ['square/square-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'rearrange a deformable rope such that it connects the two endpoints of a 3-sided square.', 'task-name': 'manipulating-rope'}
- precision_block_sorting: {'task-name': 'precision-block-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort and place a set of differently colored blocks into corresponding colored zones within a container, ensuring that each block is within its designated area without stacking.', 'assets-used': ['container/container-template.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf']}
- zone_cylinder_sorting: {'task-name': 'zone-cylinder-sorting', 'task-description': "Arrange a series of differently colored cylinders on a marked zone on the tabletop by matching each cylinder's color with the corresponding colored area within the zone.", 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf']}
- cylinder_sort_stand: {'task-name': 'cylinder-sort-stand', 'task-description': "Sort colored cylinders by placing them onto matching colored stands within a defined zone, testing the robot's precision and object recognition capabilities.", 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf']}
- precision-block-sorting: {'task-name': 'precision-block-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort and place a set of differently colored blocks into corresponding colored zones within a container, ensuring that each block is within its designated area without stacking.', 'assets-used': ['container/container-template.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf']}





=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task that adheres to the guidelines and takes into account the assets available, the request for color and shape diversity, as well as the importance of feasibility:

```python
{
    "task-name": "color-coded-container-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange five differently colored cylinders inside a corresponding colored container by ensuring each cylinder stands upright in a designated slot.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty:
- This task introduces a color matching challenge that requires precise control to place the cylinders upright in designated slots.
- The task involves both object recognition (by color) and fine manipulation (arranging the cylinders to stand upright).

Challenges:
- The robot needs to distinguish between cylinders of different colors.
- The task requires precise placement to ensure the cylinders are not only in the correct slot but also standing upright, which tests the stability and dexterity of the robot's manipulation skills.
- Managing the upright orientation within the confines of the container slots adds an extra layer of complexity to the object placement task.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task.
- It initializes various parameters such as end-effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, and workspace bounds.
- The `reset` method is used to reset the task state.
- The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward based on the current state and the defined goals.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold.
- The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- The `get_lang_goal` method retrieves the current language goal.
- The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.
- The `fill_template` method is a utility to fill a template file with specified values.
- The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment with specified poses and categories (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each subgoal includes:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
  - `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the evaluation metric for the task.
  - `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
  - `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "color-coded-container-arrangement" task. The task will involve creating objects and containers, defining their properties, and setting up the environment and goals according to the task requirements. The agent will then use the pick-and-place primitive to arrange the objects based on the defined goals, and the task's progress and completion will be tracked using the provided methods and variables.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-container-arrangement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be arranged inside corresponding colored containers. Each container and cylinder pair shares the same color, and the task is to ensure each cylinder is placed upright in a designated slot within the container. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the cylinders on the Z axis, and the target poses for the cylinders are the initial poses of the containers. The language goals provide instructions for the agent to understand the task, and the `add_goal` method is used to define the desired end state for each cylinder-container pair.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and assets provided, here's a description of a new task that introduces novelty and challenges while adhering to the constraints of tabletop manipulation:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-balancing-blocks",
    "task-description": "Balance a specified number of differently colored blocks on the rim of a bowl without letting them fall inside or outside the bowl.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

This task is novel because it requires precision in both the placement and the balance of objects. The challenge lies in carefully placing each block on the rim of the bowl without disrupting the existing balance. This demands a high level of dexterity and control from the robotic manipulator. It introduces a unique constraint by not allowing the blocks to fall into the bowl or off the tabletop, thus differentiating it from stacking or simple placement tasks.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, primitive actions, camera configurations, and workspace bounds.
- **Reset**: Prepares the task for a new episode.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the current state.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Provides additional utility functions such as filling templates with data and generating random sizes or colors for objects.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
`self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, where each pose is a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can match with multiple targets (`True`) or if each target is unique to an object (`False`).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, either by matching object poses (`pose`) or by measuring object intersection with a zone (`zone`).
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal, independent of the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A low-level language instruction describing the goal of the current step.

The `add_object` function in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation, specifying their URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for designing and implementing new tasks, such as the "bowl-balancing-blocks" task, in a robot simulation environment. The task will involve manipulating objects to balance them on the rim of a bowl, which will require careful planning and execution by the agent.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```
In this task, we're using the Suction end-effector because we need to lift the blocks and place them precisely on the rim of the bowl, which involves moving them in the Z axis. We've defined a green bowl and five blocks of different colors to be balanced on the rim of the bowl. The target poses for the blocks are calculated based on their position around the rim, and a goal is added for each block to be balanced. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1/n_blocks` to distribute the reward evenly across all block-balancing goals.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task designed according to your guidelines:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-ball-tower",
    "task-description": "Stack three differently colored balls into a vertical tower inside a bowl without the tower toppling over.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty:
This task combines precision stacking with the challenge of maintaining a delicate balance. The use of a bowl as a base adds an element of difficulty due to the curved surface, which requires the robot to be precise with stacking and balancing.

Challenges:
1. The robot must be able to pick and place the balls with precision to build a vertical tower.
2. The curvature of the bowl will test the robot's ability to balance objects in an unstable environment.
3. The task requires the coordination of fine motor skills and spatial reasoning to ensure the balls do not roll away or cause the tower to topple.
4. Different colors of the balls can be used to test the robot's color recognition and sorting abilities as an added challenge, specifying that each ball must be placed in a specific order based on color.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the environment class method `add_object`. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, defining an oracle (expert) agent, computing rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for interacting with the environment.

Key attributes and methods include:

- `reset(self, env)`: Resets the task to its initial state.
- `oracle(self, env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal sequence of actions to complete the task.
- `reward(self)`: Computes the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress.
- `done(self)`: Checks whether the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(self, pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(self, env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal(self)`: Retrieves the current language goal for the task.
- `get_reward(self)`: Returns the cumulative reward for the task.
- `fill_template(self, template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(self, min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(self, obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, its pose, and the category of the object (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each subgoal includes:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: Additional parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "bowl-ball-tower" task. The task will involve creating a simulation environment, defining the objects and their properties, and implementing the logic for the robot to stack the balls in the bowl according to the specified goals and constraints.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where three balls of different colors are to be stacked in a vertical tower inside a bowl. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the balls along the Z-axis. The target poses for the balls are calculated based on the bowl's position, with each ball being placed on top of the previous one. Each ball has a separate goal with a corresponding language instruction. The `step_max_reward` is divided equally among the goals.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a description of a new tabletop manipulation task:

```python
{
    "task-name": "container-balance-blocks",
    "task-description": "Balance a fixed number of blocks on the edges of an open container without letting them fall inside or outside the container.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of the Task Novelty and Challenges:
- The task is novel because it combines the precision required in the balancing task with the added complexity of using the edges of an open container.
- The task is challenging because it requires the robot to precisely manipulate the blocks to balance on a narrow and potentially uneven edge, without tipping the blocks into or out of the container.
- This task also tests the robot's ability to plan for stability and adapt to slight variations in block placement that could affect the overall balance.
- Unlike previous tasks that involve putting objects inside or stacking them, this task focuses on balancing objects on the periphery of another object, which is a unique manipulation skill.
- The task obeys physics and is feasible, as blocks can be balanced on edges if placed carefully, and the open container provides a clear boundary for success or failure (blocks must not fall inside or be placed outside the container).
- It is specified that a fixed number of blocks will be used, which allows for standardization of the task difficulty across different attempts.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- `ee`: The end effector used for the task (e.g., Suction).
- `mode`: The mode of the task, such as 'train'.
- `sixdof`: A boolean indicating if the task allows six degrees of freedom.
- `primitive`: The action primitive used for manipulation (e.g., PickPlace).
- `oracle_cams`: Configuration for oracle cameras.
- `pos_eps` and `rot_eps`: Position and rotation thresholds for pose evaluation.
- `bounds`: Workspace bounds for object placement.
- `zone_bounds`: Specific bounds for the zone within the workspace.
- `goals`: A list of goals for the task, each described by an 8-tuple.
- `lang_goals`: Language-based goals for the task.
- `progress`: A metric indicating the progress of the task.
- `assets_root`: The root directory for task assets.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the task.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can be matched with any target (False means each target is unique).
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if rotations are considered in the placement action.
- `metric`: The evaluation metric for the task, which can be 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: Additional parameters for the task, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing a step in the task.
- `symmetries`: The symmetry of the objects around the z-axis in radians.
- `language_goal`: The language instruction describing the goal of the current step.

### Environment Class:
- `add_object`: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying the object's URDF file, pose, and category (e.g., 'rigid').

Understanding these components is crucial for implementing the "container-balance-blocks" task. The task will involve creating a simulation environment where a robot must balance blocks on the edges of a container. The robot will use the provided APIs to interact with the environment, manipulate objects, and achieve the task goals while adhering to the constraints of physics and collision avoidance. The `self.goals` list will be populated with the necessary steps to complete the task, including the target poses for the blocks and the conditions for a successful balance.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "container-balance-blocks".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where the robot must balance a fixed number of blocks on the edges of an open container. The `ContainerBalanceBlocks` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the environment with a container and a specified number of blocks. The blocks are added to the environment with random initial poses, and goals are defined for each block to be balanced on the container's edge. The `Suction` end-effector is used to lift the blocks, and the `push` primitive is set for the task, which will be used to slide the blocks to the desired edge for balancing. The `lang_template` provides a language goal for each block, guiding the robot to balance the blocks correctly.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task that meets the criteria you've outlined:

```python
new_task = {
    "task-name": "precision-pallet-stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack a sequence of five differently colored blocks onto a single pallet, alternating the orientation of each block by 90 degrees to form a stable, interlocked structure.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

This task's novelty lies in the challenge of precision and stability. The robot needs to place each block with great care to ensure that the alternating orientation of the blocks creates an interlocked and stable structure. Additionally, the variety of colors adds complexity to the task, as the robot might be required to identify and sort the blocks by color before stacking them. This can test both the robot's manipulation skills and its ability to handle delicate placement tasks that require an understanding of structural integrity.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, primitive actions, camera configurations, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress metrics.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the current task state.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- **Task Completion**: Checks whether the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helpers**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Provides additional utility functions such as template filling and random size/color generation.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
`self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- **objs**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- **matches**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- **targ_poses**: A list of target poses, each defined by a translation (x, y, z) and a rotation quaternion (q0, q1, q2, q3).
- **replace**: A boolean indicating whether an object can match with multiple targets (`True`) or only one unique target (`False`).
- **rotations**: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- **metric**: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the subgoal, either `'pose'` for precise placement or `'zone'` for a general area.
- **params**: A list of parameters relevant to the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is `'zone'`.
- **step_max_reward**: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- **language_goal**: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

Understanding these components is crucial for writing the code for the "precision-pallet-stacking" task, which will involve creating a sequence of subgoals to stack blocks with alternating orientations onto a pallet within the specified workspace bounds. The task will require careful manipulation and placement of the blocks to ensure stability and adherence to the task's requirements.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "precision-pallet-stacking".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task for stacking blocks on a pallet with alternating orientations. The `PrecisionPalletStacking` class inherits from the `Task` base class and sets up the task environment, including the pallet and blocks, and defines the goals for stacking the blocks in the correct order and orientation. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the blocks on the Z axis, and the task is described with language templates for each block to be stacked.

Do you think your task is sufficently interesting to be added as a new task for future task given that we already have the following task name and descriptions? Moreover, does the simulation code achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task? Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and guidelines, I have conceived a new task that involves color differentiation, precision, and spatial reasoning while remaining feasible within a tabletop manipulation context. Here is the description of the task in natural language:

Task Name: "Color-Discriminated Cylinder Arrangement"

Task Description: "Arrange a set of five differently colored cylinders into matching colored zones etched into the surface of a fixture, ensuring each cylinder stands upright and aligns perfectly with the zone boundaries."

Assets Used: ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "insertion/fixture.urdf"]

The novelty of this task comes from the combination of color recognition and precise placement within defined spatial constraints. The task requires the robot to not only distinguish between different colors but also to carefully insert and align each cylinder within a specific zone on the fixture, which may have different shapes or sizes corresponding to the cylinders. The challenge is in the precision required to place the cylinders upright and align them without knocking them over or misaligning them, as well as ensuring the correct color match.

Here is the dictionary format of the new task:

```python
{
    "task-name": "color-discriminated-cylinder-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of five differently colored cylinders into matching colored zones etched into the surface of a fixture, ensuring each cylinder stands upright and aligns perfectly with the zone boundaries.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "insertion/fixture.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (training), six degrees of freedom (False), and a pick-and-place primitive. It also sets up evaluation metrics for pose accuracy, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is called to reset the task environment, initializing goals, progress, and rewards.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's metric, which can be either pose accuracy or zone coverage.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or if a certain reward threshold has been reached.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, considering object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` helper function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` helper function reads a URDF file template and replaces placeholders with specific values to generate a temporary URDF file for an object.

The `get_random_size` helper function generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` helper function assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the Environment class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, how they match with target poses, whether objects can match with multiple targets, whether rotations are considered in placements, the metric for success (pose or zone), parameters for zone metrics, the maximum reward for completing the step, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides a textual description of the current subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for implementing the "color-discriminated-cylinder-arrangement" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-discriminated-cylinder-arrangement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be arranged into matching colored zones on a fixture. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick and place the cylinders, ensuring they stand upright and align with the zone boundaries. Each cylinder and its corresponding zone are added to the environment, and goals are defined for placing each cylinder in the correct zone. The language goals provide a description of the task for each cylinder, and the `add_goal` function is used to specify the objectives of the task.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and constraints, here's a novel tabletop manipulation task described in natural language:

**Task Name**: "sequential-bowl-stacking"

**Task Description**: "Stack three bowls of different colors inside each other, starting with the largest bowl at the bottom, and finishing with the smallest bowl, requiring careful alignment during placement."

**Assets Used**: ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]

**Novelty and Challenges**: 
This task introduces the challenge of size discrimination and precise alignment in a stacking context. Unlike block stacking, bowls have curved surfaces that make nesting them within each other more difficult. The robot must carefully align each bowl's center to avoid collisions and ensure that each bowl sits properly within the previous one. Additionally, this task requires the robot to recognize and order the bowls by size, which adds complexity in terms of visual processing and decision-making.

The task can be further specified by defining the colors of the bowls, such as red, green, and blue, which adds an extra layer of complexity if the bowls need to be stacked in a particular color order.

Here is the task formatted as a Python dictionary:

```python
{
    "task-name": "sequential-bowl-stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack three differently-sized and colored bowls in a sequence from largest to smallest, ensuring each bowl is precisely nested within the larger one.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```

This task is feasible from a physics perspective, as it involves stable objects (bowls) and a manipulation task (stacking) that is well within the capabilities of current robot manipulators. It also obeys the requirement of not introducing new assets, while still providing a new and interesting challenge.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
The task is to stack three bowls of different colors inside each other, starting with the largest bowl at the bottom and finishing with the smallest bowl on top. The robot must carefully align each bowl's center to avoid collisions and ensure that each bowl sits properly within the previous one. It also needs to handle the placement of the bowls within the correct order, which adds complexity to the visual processing and decision-making. The robot must also be able to handle different sizes and colors of bowls, as well as the possibility of the bowls being stacked in a particular order or color. 

The robot must also be able to recognize the bowls by their size and color, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the visual processing and decision-making.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "sequential-bowl-stacking".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and constraints, here is a new tabletop manipulation task described in natural language:

Task Name: "cylinder-precision-placement"

Task Description: "Carefully place a set of differently colored cylinders onto corresponding colored circular zones on a pallet, ensuring each cylinder is fully within its designated zone without any overlap with other zones."

Assets Used: ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]

Explanation of Novelty and Challenges:
- The novelty lies in the combination of precision placement and color matching; the task requires the robot to precisely control the placement of objects based on their color, within tightly defined areas.
- This task combines the aspects of color recognition, fine motor control, and spatial reasoning.
- The challenge is to accurately place the cylinders within the zones without any part of the cylinder overhanging or touching the adjacent zones, which requires high dexterity and precision.
- The task involves understanding the spatial constraints of the zones on the pallet and matching colors, which can be challenging for perception and manipulation systems.

The Python dictionary would look like this:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-precision-placement",
    "task-description": "Carefully place a set of differently colored cylinders onto corresponding colored circular zones on a pallet, ensuring each cylinder is fully within its designated zone without any overlap with other zones.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, primitive actions, and camera configurations.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly for demonstration or testing purposes.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals, providing a delta reward for the current timestep.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Includes functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes, and change object colors.

### `self.goals` Variable:
- **objs (List of obj_id)**: Contains object IDs that are involved in the task.
- **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating the matching between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: Specifies the target poses for the objects, each pose being a tuple of translation and rotation.
- **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can be matched to targets uniquely or not.
- **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational component.
- **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: Defines the type of metric used to evaluate the task, either by pose matching or by zone occupancy.
- **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Provides parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
- **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing a step in the task, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- **symmetries**: Defines the symmetry of the object around the z-axis in radians, which is used for pose matching.
- **language_goal**: Contains low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The task "cylinder-precision-placement" will require careful consideration of these components to ensure that the robot can successfully place cylinders in their corresponding zones with precision. The task will involve setting up the environment with the correct objects and zones, defining the goals with appropriate target poses and matches, and implementing the reward function to provide feedback based on the task's metric (likely 'zone' in this case). The oracle agent can be used to demonstrate the task, and the done condition will need to be defined to reflect successful placement of all cylinders within their designated zones.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-precision-placement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where two differently colored cylinders must be placed onto corresponding colored zones on a pallet. The task uses a Suction end-effector to pick up the cylinders and place them in the zones. The `reset` method adds the pallet, cylinders, and zones to the environment, and sets up the goals for the task. Each cylinder has a corresponding zone with a matching color, and the task's goal is to place each cylinder into its designated zone. The `add_goal` method is called with the `zone` metric, indicating that the task is completed when each cylinder is within its corresponding zone. The `step_max_reward` is set to 1 for each goal, as there is only one goal per cylinder. The language goal provides a description of the task to be completed, which matches the motion goal.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and avoiding overlap with previous tasks, here's a new task described in natural language:

Task Name: "Zone-Box-Sequence"
Task Description: "Arrange a sequence of boxes with incremental sizes from smallest to largest into a designated goal zone, ensuring that each box's color matches the colored boundary of the zone."
Assets Used: ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

This task introduces the challenge of size discrimination and precise placement, as the robot must identify and sort boxes by size. Additionally, the robot must recognize the color of each box and match it with the corresponding colored boundary on the goal zone. This task is physically feasible and obeys the laws of physics. The incremental sizes of the boxes add to the complexity of the task, as the robot must carefully manage the available space within the goal zone to accommodate all boxes in the correct order.

The corresponding python dictionary for this task would be:

```python
{
    "task-name": "Zone-Box-Sequence",
    "task-description": "Arrange a sequence of boxes with incremental sizes from smallest to largest into a designated goal zone, ensuring that each box's color matches the colored boundary of the zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.

I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: A base class for defining a task, which includes initialization of the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) setting, primitive actions, camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

- `reset`: Resets the task environment, including goals and progress.

- `oracle`: Provides an oracle agent that can act as an expert for the task, using perfect knowledge of the environment to generate actions that accomplish the task goals.

- `reward`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the current state of the environment.

- `done`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.

- `is_match`: Determines if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational differences.

- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

- `get_lang_goal`: Retrieves the current language goal if available.

- `get_reward`: Returns the current cumulative reward.

- `fill_template`: Reads a URDF file template and replaces placeholders with specific values.

- `get_random_size`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

- `color_random_brown`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

- `add_object`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their targets.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs and components is crucial for writing the code for the "Zone-Box-Sequence" task, as they provide the necessary tools and functions to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

        # Set the reward for the entire task to be 1 (sum of step_max_reward for each goal)
        self.total_rewards = 1
```

In this code, we define a task where three boxes of incremental sizes must be placed into a goal zone. Each box has a corresponding color that matches the color of the zone. We use the `Suction` end-effector because we need to move the boxes on the Z axis. We add the goal zone and the boxes to the environment, and then we define goals for each box to be placed in the zone with the matching color. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1/n_boxes` for each goal, ensuring that the total reward for completing the task is 1.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],

reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the given assets and considering the constraints and guidelines provided, here's a new tabletop manipulation task described in natural language:

---
**Task Name:** "cylinder-bowl-arrangement"

**Task Description:** "Arrange a set of five differently colored cylinders by inserting them vertically into corresponding colored bowls, ensuring that the cylinder does not topple over."

**Assets Used:** ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]

**Novelty:** This task combines color matching with precision placement, requiring the robot to align cylinders of matching colors with the bowls and carefully insert them in a manner that keeps them upright. This tests both the sorting ability as well as delicate manipulation skills, as the cylinders must not be knocked over while being placed.

**Challenges:** The challenge lies in the precise control needed to vertically insert the cylinders without knocking them over, as well as the color recognition to match each cylinder to its corresponding bowl.

---

```python
task = {
    "task-name": "cylinder-bowl-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of five differently colored cylinders by inserting them vertically into corresponding colored bowls, ensuring that the cylinder does not topple over.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, defining an oracle (expert) agent, computing rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for interacting with the environment.

Key attributes and methods include:

- `reset(self, env)`: Resets the task to its initial state.
- `oracle(self, env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide expert actions for the task.
- `reward(self)`: Computes the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress.
- `done(self)`: Checks whether the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(self, pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetries.
- `get_random_pose(self, env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `fill_template(self, template, replace)`: Fills a URDF template file with specific values.
- `get_random_size(self, min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(self, obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` function in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes a URDF file path, a pose, and a category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) and returns the object ID.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the type of goal metric.
- `params`: A list of parameters for the goal metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

The task requires careful consideration of the physics and collision avoidance between objects, and the goal poses must be within the specified workspace bounds. The agent will use the defined goals to perform the task using pick-and-place primitives.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be arranged into corresponding colored bowls. The `CylinderBowlArrangement` class inherits from the `Task` base class and sets up the environment with the required objects and goals. The `Suction` end-effector is used because the task involves moving objects vertically. The `reset` method adds the bowls and cylinders to the environment, shuffles the colors to ensure randomness, and defines the goals for the task. Each cylinder must be placed in a bowl with a matching color, and the language goal is specified for each action. The `step_max_reward` is set to 1 for each goal since there is only one goal per cylinder.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a new task description that adheres to the guidelines provided:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-tower-challenge",
    "task-description": "Build a vertical stack of five differently colored bowls by precisely placing them on top of each other, in a sequence from largest at the bottom to smallest at the top.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of novelty and challenges:

- **Novelty:** Unlike the tasks that involve stacking solid blocks, this "bowl-tower-challenge" task requires the robot to stack objects with concave shapes (bowls) which presents a unique manipulation challenge. The task specifically requires the bowls to be stacked in a size-based sequence, which adds an extra level of complexity in terms of object recognition and sorting based on size.
  
- **Challenges:** The main challenges include:
  - **Precise Placement:** Bowls have rounded edges and are prone to rolling or sliding off each other if not placed precisely. Achieving a stable vertical tower requires a high level of accuracy in the robot's movements.
  - **Size Discrimination:** The robot must be able to discern the size differences among the bowls and stack them in the correct order.
  - **Concavity Handling:** Manipulating and aligning concave objects can be more difficult than handling blocks because the contact surfaces are not flat.
  - **Color Recognition:** The task involves differently colored bowls, requiring the robot to have the ability to identify and sort objects by color.

This task is a tabletop manipulation task that tests the robot's ability to perform precise placements, size discrimination, and color recognition all within the constraints of physical feasibility.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the task requirements. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, providing an oracle (perfect agent) for demonstrations, calculating rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for interacting with the environment.

Key components of the `Task` class include:

- `reset(self, env)`: Resets the task to its initial state.
- `oracle(self, env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly using privileged information.
- `reward(self)`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- `done(self)`: Checks whether the task has been completed or has failed.
- `is_match(self, pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering object symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(self, env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal(self)`: Returns the current language goal or a completion message if the task is done.
- `get_reward(self)`: Returns the cumulative reward for the task.
- `fill_template(self, template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(self, min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(self, obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, its pose, and its category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the metric used for the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

The task "bowl-tower-challenge" will require the implementation of these APIs to simulate the stacking of bowls in a specific order, considering the physics of the environment and the constraints of the task.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines the "bowl-tower-challenge" task, where the robot must stack five bowls of different sizes and colors on top of each other in a specific order. The task uses the Suction end-effector to pick and place the bowls. Each bowl is added to the environment with a random pose, and goals are defined for placing each bowl on top of the previous one. The `add_goal` method is used to specify the desired final pose and reward for each step of the task. The language goal is also specified for each step, providing a description of the action to be performed.
