{'task-name': 'cylinder-color-matching', 'task-description': "Arrange cylinders of varying colors onto correspondingly colored zones within a defined area, testing the robot's ability to discriminate between colors and precisely place objects.", 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from 'cylinder-sort-stand' as it focuses on precise placement in zones rather than stands, and it introduces a new challenge of matching colors with zones rather than sorting by stands. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and language descriptions, providing clear instructions and goals for the robot to place the cylinders in the correct zones. However, the task might be too similar to 'cylinder-sort-stand' and may not add significant variety or complexity to warrant inclusion in the task list.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
