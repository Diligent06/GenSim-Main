{'task-name': 'precision-block-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort and place a set of differently colored blocks into corresponding colored zones within a container, ensuring that each block is within its designated area without stacking.', 'assets-used': ['container/container-template.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder_sort_stand' and 'cylinder_color_matching' in that it involves sorting objects by color into designated areas. However, it introduces a new element of precision by requiring blocks to be placed within containers without stacking, which could add a new dimension to the sorting tasks and challenge the robot's spatial reasoning and precision placement skills. Additionally, the language descriptions are clear and align well with the task goals.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
