The task could be considered redundant due to the overlap in skills tested with existing tasks. Additionally, the language descriptions in the simulation code are not sufficiently detailed to ensure that the task requires 'perfect alignment without any offset', as the task description suggests.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
