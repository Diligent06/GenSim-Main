It requires precise manipulation and spatial reasoning to balance objects on a curved surface, which differs from flat surface placement or stacking tasks. Moreover, the task's language descriptions are clear and directly related to the goals set within the simulation code, ensuring that the task can be understood and executed as intended.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
