{'task-name': 'stand-cylinder-ring-toss', 'task-description': 'Stack a series of uniquely colored cylinders over corresponding colored stands, imitating a ring toss game, with precision aimed to fit each cylinder onto its matching stand without knocking it over.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks, introducing a new challenge of vertical alignment with precision akin to a ring toss game, which is not covered by other stacking or sorting tasks. It also combines color matching with precision placement in a novel way.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
