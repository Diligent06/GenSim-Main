{'task-name': 'cylindrical-tower-construction', 'task-description': 'Build a vertical tower by stacking five differently colored cylinders on top of each other in a specified color order onto a designated zone on the table.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from other stacking tasks like 'precision-pallet-stacking' and 'pallet_tower_building' as it requires vertical stacking in a very specific order and within a confined space. It also differs from 'cylinder_color_matching' and 'zone_cylinder_sorting' as it involves stacking rather than sorting. The simulation code appears to correctly generate the task environment, including the placement of cylinders and the zone, and sets up the language descriptions for each step. However, the task may benefit from a more complex language description to better align with the task's multi-step nature and the precision required for stacking.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
