{'task-name': 'color-coded-cylinder-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of six colored cylinders into a hexagonal formation, matching each cylinder to a specific zone on the pallet, without stacking them.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder_pallet_sorting' and 'cylinder_color_matching', which involve placing cylinders on designated colored zones. The proposed task does not introduce a significantly different challenge or require a new set of skills for the robot to learn. The hexagonal formation does not add complexity compared to existing tasks since the orientation of the cylinders is not a factor due to their symmetry.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
