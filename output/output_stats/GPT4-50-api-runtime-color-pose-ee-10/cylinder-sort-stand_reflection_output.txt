{'task-name': 'cylinder-sort-stand', 'task-description': "Sort colored cylinders by placing them onto matching colored stands within a defined zone, testing the robot's precision and object recognition capabilities.", 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks in the list, as it specifically involves sorting objects by color and placing them onto corresponding colored stands, which adds a layer of complexity involving both object recognition and precise placement. The simulation code provided does achieve the goal of the task and includes language descriptions that match the actions to be performed. However, the task might be too similar to 'place-red-in-green', which also involves color matching. To ensure diversity, the task could be adjusted to add more cylinders and stands or include additional challenges like sorting in a specific order or pattern.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
