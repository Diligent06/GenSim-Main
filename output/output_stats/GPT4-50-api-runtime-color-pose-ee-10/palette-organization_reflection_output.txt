{'task-name': 'palette-organization', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of six colored cylinders on a zone marked with colored outlines such that each cylinder stands upright within the outline matching its color, while ensuring that the cylinders do not knock over each other.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder_color_matching' and 'zone_cylinder_sorting', which involve placing cylinders into colored zones. However, 'palette-organization' adds the constraint of not knocking over other cylinders, which could introduce an additional layer of complexity and require more precise control. The language descriptions are clear and correspond to the goals set in the simulation code. The task also seems to be sufficiently different to provide a new challenge, especially with the added difficulty of maintaining the upright position of the cylinders and avoiding collisions.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
