{'task-name': 'color-coded-container-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange five differently colored cylinders inside a corresponding colored container by ensuring each cylinder stands upright in a designated slot.', 'assets-used': ['container/container-template.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder_sort_stand', 'cylinder_color_matching', 'pallet_tower_building', 'cylinder_pallet_sorting', 'zone_cylinder_sorting', and 'precision_block_sorting' which all involve sorting or placing colored objects in designated locations. However, the proposed task combines elements of precision placement (ensuring cylinders stand upright) with color matching in a container rather than on a stand or zone, which could offer a unique challenge. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and aligns with the language descriptions provided in the task. Nonetheless, the task might not be sufficiently distinct from existing tasks to warrant inclusion.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
