{'task-name': 'color-discriminated-cylinder-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of five differently colored cylinders into matching colored zones etched into the surface of a fixture, ensuring each cylinder stands upright and aligns perfectly with the zone boundaries.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'insertion/fixture.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder_color_matching' and 'zone_cylinder_sorting' which involve arranging cylinders onto colored zones. However, it introduces a new element of precision by requiring the cylinders to be placed into etched zones on a fixture, which may require more precise control. Despite this, the task might not be sufficiently differentiated from existing tasks to warrant inclusion.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
