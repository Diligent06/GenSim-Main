{'task-name': 'color-gradient-tower', 'task-description': 'Build a vertical tower of five blocks on the stand, arranging them from bottom to top to create a color gradient from red to blue, with each consecutive block having a closer shade to blue than the one below.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'stack-block-pyramid' and 'cylinder-tower-construction' as it focuses on a color gradient rather than a specific shape or alignment. The task also introduces a novel aspect of arranging objects based on color continuity, which is not covered by any current tasks. Moreover, the simulation code accurately reflects the goal and language descriptions, with clear instructions for the placement order of the blocks and appropriate language goals for each step.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
