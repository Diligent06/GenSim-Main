{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-construction', 'task-description': 'Stack five cylinders of varying colors into a vertical tower on top of a stand, ensuring each cylinder is precisely aligned with the one below.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks in the list. It introduces a challenge of vertical stacking with cylindrical objects, which requires precision in alignment, differing from the pyramid stacking and kit assembly tasks. The language descriptions in the simulation code align well with the task objective, providing clear instructions for each step of the stacking process.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
