{'task-name': 'pallet-cylinder-pattern', 'task-description': "Sort and place colored cylinders onto a pallet to form a specific checkerboard pattern, ensuring each cylinder is placed upright and matches the pattern's alternating color sequence.", 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'cylinder-tower-construction' and 'cylinder_color_match' as it involves creating a checkerboard pattern on a pallet, which requires spatial reasoning and precise placement in a 2D plane, rather than just stacking or sorting by color. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and provides clear language descriptions for the task, which is crucial for language-conditioned learning. However, the code could be improved by ensuring that the target positions on the pallet are set up to form a perfect checkerboard pattern, which is not entirely clear from the provided target positions. Additionally, the task should ensure that the number of cylinders and target positions match the intended pattern size.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
