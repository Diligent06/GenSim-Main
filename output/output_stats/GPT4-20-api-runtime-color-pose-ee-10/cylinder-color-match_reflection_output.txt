{'task-name': 'cylinder-color-match', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of colored cylinders into matching colored zones on the tabletop, ensuring that each cylinder stands upright within its respective area.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "This task is sufficiently distinct from 'cylinder-tower-construction' as it focuses on color matching and spatial arrangement rather than precision stacking. It also introduces the element of upright placement in designated zones which is not covered by the existing tasks. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal of placing cylinders in matching zones and provides clear language descriptions for the task.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
