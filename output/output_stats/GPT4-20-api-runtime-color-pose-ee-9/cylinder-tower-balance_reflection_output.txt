{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-balance', 'task-description': 'Stack three differently colored cylinders (red, green, blue) on top of each other in a designated zone on the tabletop, balancing them to form a vertical tower without toppling over.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is somewhat similar to 'precision_pallet_stack' and 'cylinder_sorting_precision', but it introduces a unique challenge of balancing the cylinders in a vertical tower without a pallet, which requires precision and stability. It also combines elements of stacking and color coordination. However, the simulation code does not currently include any checks for balance or stability, which are key aspects of the task description. The language goals are clearly defined for each cylinder, but the code should be extended to ensure that the task's unique balancing challenge is simulated and evaluated.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
