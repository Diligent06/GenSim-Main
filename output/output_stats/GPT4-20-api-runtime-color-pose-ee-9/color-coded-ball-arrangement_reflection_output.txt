The language descriptions are clear and directly tied to the task objectives. However, the task may not be sufficiently novel or complex compared to existing tasks, as it primarily combines elements of sorting by color and placing objects into containers, both of which are well-represented in the current task list.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
