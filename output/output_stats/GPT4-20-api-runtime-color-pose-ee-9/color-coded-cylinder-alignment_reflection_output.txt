{'task-name': 'color-coded-cylinder-alignment', 'task-description': "Pick up five differently colored cylinders and align them in a straight line on the tabletop, with each cylinder's color matching a designated zone's boundary color.", 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the task is distinct in its requirement to align cylinders in a straight line, it is quite similar to 'cylinder-sorting-precision' which also involves placing cylinders in colored zones. However, the 'color-coordinated-cylinder-lineup' task is more about balancing and aligning on colored lines rather than zones. The proposed task does not offer a significantly new challenge and could be seen as a variation of existing tasks. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task and the language descriptions, but the task itself does not seem to add enough novelty to the existing task list.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
