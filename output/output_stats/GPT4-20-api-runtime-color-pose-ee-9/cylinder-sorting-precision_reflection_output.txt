{'task-name': 'cylinder-sorting-precision', 'task-description': "Arrange a set of three cylinders of distinct colors (red, blue, green) on a marked three-zoned area on the tabletop, matching each cylinder's color with its corresponding colored zone.", 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks in the list, as it specifically requires sorting cylinders into zones based on color, which combines elements of color recognition, precise placement, and spatial reasoning. However, it is somewhat similar to 'precision_pallet_stack' in terms of handling cylinders and color matching. Despite this, the key difference is the spatial distribution of the zones and the one-to-one color matching, which adds a unique challenge. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and language descriptions, setting up the environment with colored zones and cylinders, and defining goals that match the language template provided.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
