It requires precision in both stacking and insertion, which could be challenging and beneficial for training manipulation algorithms. Additionally, the use of a fixture adds an extra layer of complexity. However, the task may need to be adjusted to ensure that the language descriptions are clear and the simulation code correctly reflects the task's sequential nature.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
