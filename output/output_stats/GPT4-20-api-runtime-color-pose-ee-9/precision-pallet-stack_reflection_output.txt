{'task-name': 'precision-pallet-stack', 'task-description': 'Carefully stack a sequence of five differently colored cylinders onto a single pallet by color order, ensuring each cylinder is centered and stable before adding the next one.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the current tasks such as 'stack-block-pyramid' and 'palletizing-boxes' as it introduces precision in stacking cylinders in a specific color order. It also requires the agent to ensure stability and centering of each cylinder, adding complexity to the task. However, the provided code does not include checks for the stability or centering of the cylinders before the next one is added, which is mentioned in the task description. Moreover, the language descriptions are accurate and align with the task objectives.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
