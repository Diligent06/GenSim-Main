However, the proposed task combines elements of both, adding the complexity of aligning objects on a narrow line, which could be a novel challenge. The simulation code correctly sets up the environment with randomly placed colored cylinders and lines, and the language descriptions are clear and directly related to the task goals. Nevertheless, the task may not be sufficiently distinct from existing tasks to warrant inclusion.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
