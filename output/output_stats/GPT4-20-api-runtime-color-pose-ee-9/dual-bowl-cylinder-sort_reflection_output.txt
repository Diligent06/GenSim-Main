{'task-name': 'dual-bowl-cylinder-sort', 'task-description': 'Sort a set of five cylinders by color, placing red cylinders into a red bowl and blue cylinders into a blue bowl, which are positioned at opposite ends of the tabletop.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-sorting-precision' and 'cylinder_pallet_sorting' which involve sorting cylinders by color. However, the dual-bowl setup and the specific requirement of sorting into bowls rather than zones or pallets add a slight variation. The simulation code appears to correctly set up the environment and goals according to the task description. The language descriptions are clear and match the objectives of the task. Despite the similarities, the task could still be considered if the variation is deemed sufficient to contribute to the diversity of tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
