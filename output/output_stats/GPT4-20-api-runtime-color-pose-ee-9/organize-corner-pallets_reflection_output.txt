{'task-name': 'organize-corner-pallets', 'task-description': 'Arrange four different colored boxes into corresponding color-coded corners on the tabletop using a designated pallet as an intermediary.', 'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks such as 'align-box-corner', 'palletizing-boxes', and 'precision-pallet-stack'. It introduces a two-step process that requires the robot to first move boxes to a pallet and then to specific locations, which adds complexity and requires more advanced planning and manipulation skills. The language descriptions are clear and directly related to the goals of the task, which involve both color recognition and spatial organization.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
