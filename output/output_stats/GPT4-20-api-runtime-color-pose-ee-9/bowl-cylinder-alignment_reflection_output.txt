{'task-name': 'bowl-cylinder-alignment', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of three differently colored cylinders around a central bowl without touching it, each cylinder standing upright at equidistant points on an imaginary circle around the bowl.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the other tasks listed, as it requires precise placement of objects around a central point without contact, which is a new challenge not covered by the existing tasks. Moreover, the task's language descriptions are clear and directly map to the goals of the task, which are to place each colored cylinder at a specified position relative to the bowl. The simulation code appears to correctly set up the environment, add the objects, and define the goals, which should allow for the task to be achieved as described.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
