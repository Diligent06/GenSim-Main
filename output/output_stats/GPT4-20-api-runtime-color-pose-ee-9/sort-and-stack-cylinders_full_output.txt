================= Task and Asset Design!

>>> Prompt: 
You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 

=========
Here are all the assets. Use only these assets in the task and code design.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}

- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a description of a new tabletop manipulation task in natural language, formatted as a Python dictionary with the required keys and value types:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-barrier-sorting",
    "task-description": "Pick up colored cylinders and place them on the opposite side of a row of boxes, using the boxes as barriers that segregate cylinders by color.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

**Novelty and Challenges:**

1. **Color-based Segregation:** The task involves multiple colored cylinders that need to be segregated based on their color. This adds a cognitive challenge of identifying colors and segregating objects accordingly.
   
2. **Use of Barriers:** The boxes act as barriers that the robot has to navigate around to place the cylinders on the opposite side, adding spatial reasoning and path planning to the task complexity.

3. **Precise Placement:** The task requires precise placement of the cylinders in designated zones across the barriers, ensuring not only the correct sorting but also accuracy in the placement within confined areas.

4. **Physical Interaction with Barriers:** Depending on the implementation, the robot may interact with the boxes to reposition them, adding an element of environment manipulation to the task. However, this interaction must still respect the primary goal of using the boxes as segregation barriers.

This task leverages color differentiation, navigation around obstacles, and precise object placement, all of which are crucial skills for tabletop manipulation and robotics in general.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, a pick-and-place primitive, and camera configurations. It also sets up evaluation metrics for pose accuracy, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task environment, setting up goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the best pick-and-place actions to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the current state of the environment. It uses different metrics such as pose accuracy or zone coverage to evaluate the performance.

The `done` method checks whether the task has been completed or if a failure condition has been met.

The `is_match` helper function determines if two poses match within a specified tolerance, considering both position and rotation.

The `get_random_pose` helper function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal, which provides a textual description of the task's objective.

The `fill_template` method is a utility for reading a file template and replacing placeholders with specific values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, their target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the evaluation metric, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the step, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides a textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for implementing the "cylinder-barrier-sorting" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-barrier-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

# The z-axis is vertical. The zone is placed at an x-coordinate of 0.85, which is on the opposite side
# of the boxes from the starting x-coordinates of the cylinders.
```

This code sets up a task where colored cylinders must be sorted by placing them on the opposite side of a row of boxes, using the boxes as barriers. The Suction end-effector is used to pick up and move the cylinders in the Z-axis. The task is set up with a language goal for each cylinder, and the `add_goal` function is used to define the desired final pose for each cylinder. The `max_steps` is set to twice the number of goals to provide enough steps for the task to be completed.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a description of a new task that follows the provided guidelines and tries to introduce novelty and challenge:

```python
task = {
    "task-name": "sort-and-stack-cylinders",
    "task-description": "Sort a collection of cylinders by color and stack them in ascending order of height within designated colored zones.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

**Novelty:**
This task introduces the concept of sorting objects by color, which adds a perception challenge and requires the robot to have color recognition capabilities. Additionally, stacking the cylinders in ascending order of height adds a layer of complexity as the robot must also evaluate and sort the cylinders by size.

**Challenges:**
- **Perception and Sorting**: The robot must be able to distinguish between cylinders of different colors and direct them to the correct zone.
- **Height Evaluation**: It must assess the height of each cylinder to stack them correctly.
- **Stable Stacking**: The robot must carefully place the cylinders on top of each other to avoid toppling, which requires precise control.
- **Zone-based Organization**: Since each color has a designated zone, the robot must navigate the workspace efficiently to place the cylinders in the correct areas.

This task combines color and size discrimination with precise manipulation, which can be beneficial for developing algorithms for sorting and organizing objects based on multiple attributes.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the environment helper functions and the `add_object` method. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robot simulation tasks. It initializes with default values for various parameters, including the end effector type (`Suction`), the mode (`train`), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`). It also sets up a pick-and-place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds for position and rotation (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, clearing goals and resetting progress and rewards. The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can calculate the perfect action based on the current state of the environment, using RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks.

The `reward` method calculates the delta rewards for the current timestep based on the current goal step, which can involve matching object poses or measuring object intersection with a zone. The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors. The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file and replace key strings with specified values. The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds. The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, the target poses, whether objects can match with multiple targets, whether rotations are considered, the metric for success (`pose` or `zone`), parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the step, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides low-level language instructions for the step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the code for the "sort-and-stack-cylinders" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds. The task will involve creating subgoals for sorting and stacking cylinders by color and height, and will use the provided APIs to interact with the simulation environment and the robot agent.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "sort-and-stack-cylinders".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where cylinders of different colors and heights are sorted and stacked in designated zones. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the cylinders vertically. Each cylinder is assigned a random color and size, and the goal is to place each cylinder in a zone of the same color. The cylinders are sorted by color and height to determine the order in which they should be stacked. The `add_goal` method is used to define the desired final position for each cylinder, and the reward is distributed evenly across the number of cylinders. The `max_steps` is set to twice the number of goals to provide enough steps for the agent to complete the task.
