{'task-name': 'checkerboard-cylinder-palletizing', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set number of differently colored cylinders on a pallet in a checkerboard pattern, alternating colors both row-wise and column-wise.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing 'cylinder-sorting', 'color-matched-cylinder-placement', 'cylinder_precision_placement', 'cylinder_balance_beam', and 'precision_pallet_stacking' tasks. It introduces a new pattern (checkerboard) and requires precise placement with alternating colors, which adds complexity and requires spatial reasoning and planning. The simulation code specifies the task setup and goals, and the language descriptions are clear and aligned with the task objectives. However, the code assumes a simple 2x2 pattern which would need to be expanded to fully realize a checkerboard pattern for a more interesting task.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
