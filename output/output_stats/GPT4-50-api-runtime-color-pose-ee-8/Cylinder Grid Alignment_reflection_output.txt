{'task-name': 'Cylinder Grid Alignment', 'task-description': "Arrange five differently colored cylinders standing upright in a specific order within five designated areas on a grid marked by a container, ensuring each cylinder's color matches its designated area.", 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'container/container-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks such as 'checkerboard-cylinder-palletizing', 'bowl_stand_cylinder_alignment', and 'color_matched_cylinder_placement' as it involves spatial organization on a grid with a matching color component, but it is not entirely unique. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and language descriptions in the task, but the task may not be complex enough or offer a novel challenge that is not already covered by the combination of existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
