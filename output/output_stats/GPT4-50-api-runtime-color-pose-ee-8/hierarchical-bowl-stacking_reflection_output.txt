However, the task description does not explicitly mention the use of a designated zone, which is a key element in the task. The simulation code seems to achieve the goal, but it does not check if the stacking is done within the designated zone, which is mentioned in the task description. The language descriptions in the task are clear and correspond to the goals set within the code.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
