{'task-name': 'color-matched-cylinder-placement', 'task-description': 'Pick up three different colored cylinders and place each one into the corresponding colored zone.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder_sorting' and 'cylinder-sorting' which involve picking and placing cylinders based on color or size. However, this task focuses on exact color matching rather than sorting by height. It adds variety by requiring precise placement within designated zones, which is not covered by the existing cylinder tasks. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task and language descriptions, ensuring that each cylinder is matched with a zone of the same color and that the task description is clear and unambiguous.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
