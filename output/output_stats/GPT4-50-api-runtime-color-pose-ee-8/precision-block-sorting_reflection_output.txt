{'task-name': 'precision-block-sorting', 'task-description': 'Pick up five blocks of different shapes (cube, ell, cylinder, and ball) and place each one into a matching outline on a large box, ensuring proper orientation and alignment for non-spherical shapes.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/block.urdf', 'insertion/ell.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf', 'box/box-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently different from existing tasks, as it combines shape recognition, precise placement, and orientation alignment, which are not covered by any single task in the current list. It also uses a diverse set of assets and introduces a new challenge of matching non-spherical shapes to outlines, which is unique compared to the stacking and sorting tasks listed.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
