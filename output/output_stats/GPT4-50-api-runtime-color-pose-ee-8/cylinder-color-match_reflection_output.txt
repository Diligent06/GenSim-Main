{'task-name': 'cylinder-color-match', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of differently colored cylinders into corresponding colored zones on a pallet, ensuring each cylinder is placed upright and sorted by color.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from existing tasks such as 'cylinder-sorting' and 'cylinder_precision_placement' as it requires matching colors rather than sorting by size or placing in a pattern. However, it is somewhat similar to 'color_matched_cylinder_placement', but with the added complexity of using a pallet and having the cylinders placed upright, which could make it a more challenging and interesting task. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal of the task and the language descriptions are clear and unambiguous.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
