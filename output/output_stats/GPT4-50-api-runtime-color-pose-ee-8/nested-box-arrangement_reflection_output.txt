{'task-name': 'nested-box-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of color-specific small boxes inside bigger boxes with matching colors, ensuring that each small box is fully contained within its corresponding larger box without any overlap.', 'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the other tasks in the list, as it specifically focuses on nesting objects of matching colors, which combines precision placement with color matching. It also introduces a spatial reasoning challenge that is not explicitly covered by the other tasks, such as 'packing-boxes' or 'palletizing-boxes', which involve stacking but not nesting. Moreover, the simulation code provided appears to correctly implement the task requirements and language descriptions.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
