{'task-name': 'pallet-jenga', 'task-description': 'Construct a Jenga-like tower on a pallet using six uniquely colored blocks by placing them in alternating directions in each layer, ensuring the tower is stable and does not topple over.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks in the list as it involves a unique combination of precision stacking and stability, which are not covered by other tasks. The simulation code appears to correctly set up the environment and goals, and the language descriptions are clear and directly related to the task objectives.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
