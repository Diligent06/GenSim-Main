The simulation code appears to correctly initialize the task environment with the required objects, assigns language descriptions for each goal, and defines the goals with the correct target poses for the cylinders. However, the code should be tested to ensure it runs without errors and that the language goals correctly correspond to the actions required in the simulation.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
