{'task-name': 'cylindrical-tower-balancing', 'task-description': "Stack five differently colored cylinders on top of each other in a single vertical tower on the designated zone, with the tower's stability being a challenge due to cylinder diameter variations.", 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing 'cylinder-sorting' and 'color-sequenced-cylinder-stack' tasks as it introduces the element of stability with varying cylinder diameters, which is not covered by the other tasks. It also requires precise control to stack cylinders vertically, adding to its complexity. The simulation code correctly implements the task, and the language descriptions are appropriately defined for each subgoal.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
