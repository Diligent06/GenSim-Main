{'task-name': 'bowl-ball-sorting', 'task-description': 'Pick up and place five differently colored balls into their corresponding colored bowls, distributed randomly on the tabletop.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'bowl-stand-cylinder-alignment' and 'bowl-crown-stack' in terms of using bowls and sorting objects by color. However, it introduces a unique challenge by requiring the sorting of spherical objects, which have different dynamics and grasping challenges compared to cylindrical objects. The language descriptions are clear and directly related to the task goals. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal of placing balls into the corresponding colored bowls and includes language descriptions for each goal. However, the task may not be sufficiently distinct from existing sorting tasks to warrant addition.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
