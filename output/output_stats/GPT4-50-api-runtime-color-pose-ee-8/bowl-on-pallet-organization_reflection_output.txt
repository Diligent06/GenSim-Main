{'task-name': 'bowl-on-pallet-organization', 'task-description': "Arrange a set of four differently colored bowls in a 2x2 grid pattern on a pallet, with each bowl's color matching the designated corner zone color.", 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'bowl/bowl.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task introduces an interesting combination of object arrangement and color matching, which is not explicitly covered in the current task list. It requires spatial reasoning to place the bowls correctly and also incorporates color recognition. However, the task may be considered a variation of 'checkerboard-cylinder-palletizing' with a simpler pattern and different objects. To ensure it adds sufficient novelty, we could adjust the task to increase complexity, such as by adding more bowls or introducing additional constraints.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
