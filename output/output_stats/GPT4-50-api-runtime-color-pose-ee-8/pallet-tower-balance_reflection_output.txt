{'task-name': 'pallet-tower-balance', 'task-description': 'Stack a cylinder, a ball, and a block on top of each other in the center of a pallet, ensuring the tower remains balanced for a specified duration.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the proposed task involves stacking different shapes which is not covered by the current tasks, the simulation code provided does not check for the balance of the tower over a specified duration. The task description mentions ensuring the tower remains balanced for a specified duration, but the code does not include any mechanism to verify this condition. Additionally, the language descriptions in the task are clear and align with the goals set in the code, but the task may not be sufficiently distinct or complex compared to existing stacking tasks such as 'precision-pallet-stacking' and 'stack-block-pyramid'. To make this task unique, it would need to include the balance check over time and possibly involve more complex shapes or additional constraints.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
