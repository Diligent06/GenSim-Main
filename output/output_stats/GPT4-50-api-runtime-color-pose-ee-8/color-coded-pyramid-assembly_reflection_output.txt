{'task-name': 'color-coded-pyramid-assembly', 'task-description': 'Construct a color-coded pyramid by stacking a blue block, a red block, and a green block on a stand, with the base layer consisting of the blue block, followed by the red block, and topped by the green block.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/block.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from 'stack-block-pyramid' as it involves a specific color-coded sequence and only three blocks, which makes it simpler but still requires precision. The language descriptions are clear and directly related to the task objectives. However, the task may not be as complex or interesting as other tasks on the list, such as 'precision-pallet-stack' or 'nested-box-arrangement', which involve more intricate stacking or arranging. The simulation code appears to correctly set up the task environment and goals, but it lacks the actual control logic for the robot to execute the task.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
