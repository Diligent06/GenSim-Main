{'task-name': 'cylinder-precision-placement', 'task-description': 'Arrange five colored cylinders in a specific pattern within a marked zone on the tabletop, ensuring each cylinder stands upright and matches its designated area by color.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder_sorting' and 'color_matched_cylinder_placement' but adds the additional complexity of placing the cylinders in a specific pattern while maintaining an upright position. It requires precise control and spatial reasoning, which could be beneficial for training manipulation agents. However, the task could be considered redundant due to the presence of similar tasks, and the language descriptions are sufficiently clear and aligned with the task goals.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
