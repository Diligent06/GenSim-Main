{'task-name': 'precision-pallet-stack', 'task-description': 'Stack a pyramid of colored cylinders on the pallet, alternating colors for each of the three levels, with a specific sequence for colors on each level.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'precision_pallet_stacking' and 'checkerboard-cylinder-palletizing' as it involves stacking in a pyramid shape with an alternating color sequence for each level, which adds complexity and requires precise control. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task objectives and language descriptions, providing clear goals for the stacking sequence and positioning.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
