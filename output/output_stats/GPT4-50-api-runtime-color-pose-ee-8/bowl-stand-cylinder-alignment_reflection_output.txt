{'task-name': 'bowl-stand-cylinder-alignment', 'task-description': "Arrange a set of colored cylinders on a stand, each within a matching colored bowl, ensuring the cylinder's color sequence follows a predefined pattern.", 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from existing tasks such as 'cylinder_sorting' and 'color_matched_cylinder_placement' as it introduces the additional complexity of placing cylinders within bowls that are on a stand, which requires precise spatial alignment. Moreover, the task integrates color matching with spatial reasoning, which is not covered by any single task in the current list. The language descriptions accurately reflect the task objectives, and the simulation code appears to correctly implement the task setup and goals.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
