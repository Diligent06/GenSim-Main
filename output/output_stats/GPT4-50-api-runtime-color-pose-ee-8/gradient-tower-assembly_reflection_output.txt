{'task-name': 'gradient-tower-assembly', 'task-description': 'Sequentially stack five differently sized cylinders to form a gradient tower, with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top, each cylinder having a unique color to form a color gradient when completed.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the task is somewhat similar to 'cylinder-sorting' and 'precision-pallet-stack', it introduces a unique challenge by requiring the agent to stack cylinders in a specific size and color order to form a gradient, which is different from sorting by size or creating a checkerboard pattern. The task also has clear language descriptions that align with the goal of the task, making it suitable for language-conditioned learning. However, the task may not be sufficiently distinct from existing stacking tasks to warrant addition.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
