{'task-name': 'precision-block-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort differently colored blocks into corresponding colored zones on a pallet, ensuring each block is precisely placed within its designated outline without displacing any adjacent blocks.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the current tasks, such as 'cylinder_pallet_arrangement' and 'bowl_cylinder_sorting', as it involves sorting square blocks instead of cylinders or placing them into bowls. It also emphasizes precision in placement without displacement of adjacent blocks, which adds a unique challenge. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task and language descriptions, as it sets up the environment with colored zones and blocks, assigns goals for each block, and provides a language template for the sorting task.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
