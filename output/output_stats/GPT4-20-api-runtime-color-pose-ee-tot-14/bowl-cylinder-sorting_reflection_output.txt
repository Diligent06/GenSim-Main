{'task-name': 'bowl-cylinder-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort colored cylinders by placing each one into a bowl with a matching color that is randomly placed on the tabletop.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "This task is sufficiently different from the 'place-red-in-green' task as it involves sorting multiple colors and matching them with corresponding bowls, which adds complexity and requires color recognition and matching skills. Additionally, the provided simulation code accurately achieves the goal and language descriptions specified in the task, with each cylinder being placed into a bowl with a matching color and the language template reflecting this goal.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
