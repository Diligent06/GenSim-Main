{'task-name': 'ball-sort-into-colored-boxes', 'task-description': 'Sort a set of colored balls into corresponding colored boxes arranged in a line on the tabletop.', 'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks in the list as it requires sorting spherical objects (balls) instead of blocks or cylinders. None of the current tasks involve sorting balls specifically, and this task would require precision in both perception and manipulation to correctly sort the balls based on color. Additionally, the task's language description is clear and aligns well with the simulation code, which sets up the environment and goals appropriately. However, the task may be too similar to 'bowl_cylinder_sorting' and 'precision_block_sorting', which also involve sorting objects by color into corresponding containers.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
