{'task-name': 'sequential-bowl-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack a series of three differently colored bowls within a marked zone on the tabletop, with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top, without the stack toppling over.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'cylinder_tower_construction' and 'stack-block-pyramid' as it focuses on stacking objects with a concave shape (bowls) which presents a different challenge. Additionally, the task requires specific color order and positioning within a marked zone, which adds to its complexity. The simulation code provided appears to achieve the goal and includes language descriptions that match the task requirements. However, the code needs to ensure that the bowls are stacked with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top, which is not explicitly enforced in the provided code.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
