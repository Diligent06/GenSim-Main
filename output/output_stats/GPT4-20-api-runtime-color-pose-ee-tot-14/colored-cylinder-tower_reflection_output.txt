{'task-name': 'colored-cylinder-tower', 'task-description': 'Sequentially stack four differently colored cylinders onto a stand, creating a tower with the order of colors specified in advance.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-tower-construction' but with a fixed order of colors and a stand. The fixed color order adds an extra layer of complexity and the use of a stand differentiates it from simply stacking on a tabletop. However, it may not be sufficiently distinct or innovative compared to existing tasks such as 'stack-block-pyramid' which also involves stacking in a specific order, and 'corner-cylinder-stacking' which includes precise placement. The simulation code correctly implements the task and language descriptions, but the task itself may not offer a unique enough challenge to justify its addition.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
