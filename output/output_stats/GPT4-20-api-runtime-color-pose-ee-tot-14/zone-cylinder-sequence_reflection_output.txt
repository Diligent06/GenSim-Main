{'task-name': 'zone-cylinder-sequence', 'task-description': "Place a sequence of differently colored cylinders into corresponding color-coded zones on the tabletop, ensuring that each cylinder's base fits within its designated zone without toppling any others.", 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'cylinder-pallet-arrangement' and 'bowl-cylinder-sorting' as it requires sequential placement rather than an arrangement on a pallet or sorting into bowls. It also introduces the additional challenge of fitting cylinders within a specific area without toppling others, which is not explicitly required in the other tasks. Moreover, the simulation code aligns with the goal and language descriptions by creating a sequence of colored cylinders and zones, shuffling colors for variability, and defining language goals for each action.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
