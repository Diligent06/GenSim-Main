{'task-name': 'corner-cylinder-stacking', 'task-description': 'Sequentially stack three differently colored cylinders next to each other in a corner, making sure they touch both walls of the corner without knocking any over.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from existing tasks such as 'cylinder-pallet-arrangement' and 'bowl-cylinder-sorting' as it introduces the complexity of stacking in a constrained corner space, which requires precise manipulation and spatial reasoning. The language descriptions are clear and directly related to the task objectives. However, the code provided does not fully match the task description, as it does not ensure that cylinders touch both walls of the corner, nor does it prevent cylinders from knocking over. These conditions need to be checked and enforced either through task design or reward shaping.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
