{'task-name': 'cylinder-height-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort a set of cylinders of varying heights into ascending order on the stand from shortest to tallest.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing 'tower-of-hanoi', 'cylinder_precision_stack', and 'cylinder_sort_zone' tasks as it focuses on sorting by height rather than color or precise placement in a pattern. It also adds an element of spatial reasoning in terms of height discrimination, which is not covered by the other tasks. However, the simulation code needs to ensure that the cylinders can be uniquely identified by height and that the language description accurately reflects the task's requirements.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
