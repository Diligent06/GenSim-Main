It also has a clear language description that matches the goal of the task. However, the simulation code provided does not include the necessary functions such as 'get_random_pose' or 'fill_template', which are critical for the task's functionality. These functions would need to be defined or imported from the appropriate modules for the code to work as intended.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
