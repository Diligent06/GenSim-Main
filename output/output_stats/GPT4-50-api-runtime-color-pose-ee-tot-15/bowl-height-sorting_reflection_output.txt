{'task-name': 'bowl-height-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort bowls by size by stacking them inside each other from largest at the bottom to smallest at the top in a designated zone.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The proposed task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks as it involves sorting objects (bowls) by size in a specific configuration (stacking inside each other), which is not covered by any current task. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task objectives and provides clear language descriptions for each step of the task. However, the task may be similar to 'cylinder-height-sorting', but it differs in the objects used (bowls vs. cylinders) and the stacking method (inside each other vs. on a stand).", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
