{'task-name': 'cylinder-precision-stack', 'task-description': 'Sequentially stack three differently colored cylinders on top of each other on a stand, in a specified color order without knocking them over.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing 'tower-of-hanoi' task, which involves sorting cylinders by size rather than color and does not require precision stacking on a narrow stand. Additionally, the 'stack-block-pyramid' task involves creating a pyramid with a different shape and color ordering. The proposed task combines precision, color recognition, and sequential stacking, which can be beneficial for training more advanced manipulation skills. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and language descriptions by setting up the environment, defining the goals, and providing language instructions for each step.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
