{'task-name': 'cylinder-color-match', 'task-description': 'Pick up cylinders of different colors and place them upright into matching color zones marked on the tabletop.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from existing tasks such as 'sort-balls-into-containers' and 'cylinder-precision-stack' as it requires precise placement of cylinders into flat zones rather than containers or on top of other objects. Additionally, the task combines color matching with spatial reasoning, which can be beneficial for developing more complex manipulation skills in robots. However, the task may not be considered highly complex since it involves only two objects and their corresponding zones, which may limit the learning potential when compared to tasks with more objects or more intricate placement strategies.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
