{'task-name': 'colorful-tower-challenge', 'task-description': 'Sequentially stack one cylinder, one block, and one ball on top of each other on a designated zone, with each object in a different specified color, maintaining balance.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks in the list, as it combines elements of stacking, color differentiation, and balance in a unique way. None of the current tasks require stacking a cylinder, block, and ball in sequence, which could present a novel challenge to the manipulation agent. Additionally, the task's language descriptions are clear and directly map to the goals set within the simulation code.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
