{'task-name': 'cylinder-lineup', 'task-description': 'Align five cylinders of different colors in a row on the tabletop, following a specific color sequence provided.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is somewhat similar to 'cylinder-sequence-alignment' and 'cylinder-sort-zone', but it differs in that it requires aligning cylinders in a row rather than end-to-end or in separate zones. However, the task may not be sufficiently novel or complex, as it is essentially a simpler version of 'cylinder-sequence-alignment' without the additional challenge of aligning along colored lines. Furthermore, the simulation code provided does not include the necessary imports and class definitions for the Suction end-effector, and the 'additional_reset' method is called without being defined, which would result in an error.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
