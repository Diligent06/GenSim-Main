{'task-name': 'cylinder-sequence-alignment', 'task-description': 'Align differently colored cylinders end-to-end on their corresponding colored lines marked on the tabletop.', 'assets-used': ['line/single-green-line-template.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'cylinder_precision_stack', 'cylinder_color_match', and 'cylinder_sort_zone', which involve stacking, matching, and sorting, respectively. The proposed task involves precise alignment of cylinders with corresponding colored lines, which adds a unique challenge of spatial alignment rather than just placement. Moreover, the simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, including the language descriptions for the goals, which are specific and clear. However, the max_steps parameter might need adjustment depending on the actual number of goals set during the task initialization.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
