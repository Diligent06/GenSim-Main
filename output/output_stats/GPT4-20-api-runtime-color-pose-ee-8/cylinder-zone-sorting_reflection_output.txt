{'task-name': 'cylinder-zone-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort five cylinders of different colors into five designated zones based on color matching without disturbing adjacent neutral zones.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'cylinder-tower-balancing' as it involves sorting into zones rather than stacking for balance. It introduces a color matching component which is not covered by 'cylinder-tower-balancing'. However, it is somewhat similar to 'sort-blocks-by-zone', yet it uses cylinders instead of blocks and adds the constraint of not disturbing adjacent neutral zones which could add an additional layer of complexity and learning opportunity. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and language descriptions by creating the cylinders, shuffling their colors, and adding corresponding colored zones with language goals for each placement. The task is interesting as it combines aspects of sorting, precise placement, and spatial awareness.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
