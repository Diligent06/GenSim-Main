{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-balancing', 'task-description': 'Build a vertical stack of three differently colored cylinders on top of a flat box, ensuring the tower remains balanced and upright for a specified time.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'box/box-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks as it combines precision stacking with the challenge of maintaining balance, which is not explicitly covered in the current task list. Moreover, the simulation code achieves the goal of stacking cylinders in a specific order with language descriptions that are clear and directly related to the task objectives. The task also introduces a new element of balance which is not present in the 'stack-block-pyramid' task, adding to its uniqueness and complexity.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
