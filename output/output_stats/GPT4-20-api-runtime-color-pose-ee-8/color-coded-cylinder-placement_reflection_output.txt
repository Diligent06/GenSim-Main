{'task-name': 'color-coded-cylinder-placement', 'task-description': 'Arrange five differently colored cylinders on corresponding colored zones on a pallet, ensuring each cylinder stands upright without any support.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'cylinder-zone-sorting' as it requires precise placement on a pallet and ensuring the cylinders stand upright, adding a stability challenge. It also differs from 'cylinder_tower_balance' which focuses on stacking cylinders by size rather than color coordination. However, the task has similarities with 'precision_placement_pyramid' and 'cylinder_zone_sorting', which involve color matching and placement. To justify its addition, the task should emphasize the unique challenge of placing the cylinders upright on a less stable surface (the pallet) and the potential for more complex manipulation strategies that this entails.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
