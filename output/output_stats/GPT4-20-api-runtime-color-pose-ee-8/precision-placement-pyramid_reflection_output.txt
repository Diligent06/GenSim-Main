{'task-name': 'precision-placement-pyramid', 'task-description': 'Arrange three differently colored cylinders and two differently colored blocks to form a color-sorted pyramid on a green zone, with the cylinders forming the base and the blocks stacked on top.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from existing tasks such as 'stack-block-pyramid' and 'cylinder-tower-balancing' as it involves a combination of both cylinders and blocks to create a pyramid structure, which requires precision placement. The task also incorporates a color-sorting component, which is not present in the 'stack-block-pyramid' task. Furthermore, the simulation code correctly initializes the task environment with the required objects and defines clear language goals for each step, which aligns with the task description. However, the target poses for the cylinders and blocks are not correctly defined in the code. All three cylinders are given the same base position without offsets, and the blocks' positions need to account for the positions of the cylinders they are to be placed on.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
