{'task-name': 'bowl-pyramid-precision', 'task-description': 'Stack three differently sized bowls into a descending size order pyramid on a flat surface without the structure toppling over, ensuring the smallest bowl rests at the top.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks, as it focuses on precise stacking of bowls which are concave objects, unlike the blocks and cylinders used in other stacking tasks. This introduces a unique challenge in terms of object manipulation and stability. Additionally, the task uses a pallet as a base, which is not a common element in other tasks. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, with language descriptions matching the actions required to complete the task. The task also has a clear completion criterion and provides a different challenge compared to the existing block and cylinder stacking tasks.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
