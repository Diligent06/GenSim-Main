================= Task and Asset Design!

>>> Prompt: 
You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 

=========
Here are all the assets. Use only these assets in the task and code design.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

=========
Now you are asked to generate three new tasks in natural language and choose one of them that you think is the most diverse compared to what is currently available. And briefly explain what your reasons for choosing it are and what is innovative about this task.
In response, you must give your chosen answer at the end, e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.
Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

For example:
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "sort-cylinders-box"
    "task-description": "Sort differently colored cylindrical objects into a box where each corner is marked for a specific color."
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "stack-cylinders-pallet"
    "task-description": "Stack differently sized cylinders onto a pallet, with the largest cylinders at the bottom and the smallest at the top." 
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ball-cylinder-insertion"
    "task-description": "Pick up balls of different sizes and fit them into a cylinder of matching size."
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Answer: I choose Task 2: "stack-cylinders-pallet".

Reason: While there are tasks involving stacking or sorting boxes or blocks, none of them involves stacks of cylinders. This task is sort of similar to the task of stacking blocks into a pyramid but it uses cylinders and a pallet instead of blocks and a stand. It also involves arranging objects in order of size which adds an additional level of complexity.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "organize-bowls-on-pallet",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of five different colored bowls in a specific color order on a pallet.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf"]
}

Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "precision-ball-placement",
    "task-description": "Place balls of increasing sizes into a line formation within the boundaries of an elongated zone marked on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}

Task 3:
{
    "task-name": "synchronized-block-insertion",
    "task-description": "Insert a set of blocks into their corresponding fixtures on a timed sequence without collision.",
    "assets-used": ["insertion/ell.urdf", "insertion/fixture.urdf"]
}

Answer: I choose Task 2: "precision-ball-placement".

Reason: The task of precision ball placement capitalizes on the challenge of careful positioning and size discrimination. Unlike the stacking tasks which involve vertical organization, this task requires horizontal precision alignment within a designated area, which introduces a different type of spatial reasoning. It's also unique in that it doesn't involve any container or enclosure but rather demands precision within open space, which is a challenge that hasn't been addressed in the other tasks. This task will also require the robot to recognize and differentiate sizes to place the balls in the correct order, adding an extra layer of complexity.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), training mode, six degrees of freedom (6DoF) flag, pick and place primitives, and camera configurations. It also sets up evaluation metrics for pose accuracy, workspace bounds, and initializes variables for goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task state and is called at the beginning of each new episode. It requires that the `assets_root` directory be set, which contains the assets needed for the task.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the actions needed to match objects to their targets.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the current state of the task. It supports two types of metrics: 'pose' and 'zone'. The 'pose' metric checks if objects are within a certain pose threshold of their targets, while the 'zone' metric checks if objects are within a specified zone.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or if a certain reward threshold has been reached.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method is a utility for reading a file template and replacing key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for a box within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the type of metric used for the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the task "organize-bowls-on-pallet" as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment and define the task logic.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "organize-bowls-on-pallet".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way.

1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where five bowls of different colors must be arranged on a pallet in a specific order. The `OrganizeBowlsOnPallet` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment, including the pallet and bowls, and defines the goals for the task. The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment for a new episode. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick up and place the bowls, and the target positions for the bowls are calculated based on their order and the dimensions of the pallet. The `add_goal` method is called for each bowl to define the desired end state for the task.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

=========
Now you are asked to generate three new tasks in natural language and choose one of them that you think is the most diverse compared to what is currently available. And briefly explain what your reasons for choosing it are and what is innovative about this task.
In response, you must give your chosen answer at the end, e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.
Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

For example:
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "sort-cylinders-box"
    "task-description": "Sort differently colored cylindrical objects into a box where each corner is marked for a specific color."
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "stack-cylinders-pallet"
    "task-description": "Stack differently sized cylinders onto a pallet, with the largest cylinders at the bottom and the smallest at the top." 
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ball-cylinder-insertion"
    "task-description": "Pick up balls of different sizes and fit them into a cylinder of matching size."
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Answer: I choose Task 2: "stack-cylinders-pallet".

Reason: While there are tasks involving stacking or sorting boxes or blocks, none of them involves stacks of cylinders. This task is sort of similar to the task of stacking blocks into a pyramid but it uses cylinders and a pallet instead of blocks and a stand. It also involves arranging objects in order of size which adds an additional level of complexity.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-color-match",
    "task-description": "Organize differently colored cylinders into corresponding colored zones on a tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "ball-sorting-into-boxes",
    "task-description": "Sort differently sized balls into boxes, where each box is labeled with a size marker.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3:
{
    "task-name": "sequential-bowl-filling",
    "task-description": "Fill bowls sequentially with colored balls, matching the color sequence of a visual guide line.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}

Answer: I choose Task 3: "sequential-bowl-filling".

Reason: This task introduces a new dimension of complexity by combining color matching with sequence following and is different from existing tasks. Unlike tasks that only involve sorting based on size or color, this task requires the robot to recognize a sequence and place the balls in the correct order into bowls. It adds visual recognition of color patterns along with manipulation, increasing the cognitive load of the task without violating the constraints of pick and place actions.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a simulation task. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the pick and place primitive (`primitive`), and the oracle cameras (`oracle_cams`). It also sets up evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment.
- `oracle(env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide the optimal actions for the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Retrieves the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with the specified URDF file, pose, and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-color-match" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where differently colored cylinders must be organized into corresponding colored zones. The task uses suction as the end-effector since the cylinders need to be lifted and moved to the zones. The `CylinderColorMatch` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment, including the cylinders and zones, and defines the goals for the task. The `reset` method is called to initialize the task environment for each new episode.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

=========
Now you are asked to generate three new tasks in natural language and choose one of them that you think is the most diverse compared to what is currently available. And briefly explain what your reasons for choosing it are and what is innovative about this task.
In response, you must give your chosen answer at the end, e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.
Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

For example:
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "sort-cylinders-box"
    "task-description": "Sort differently colored cylindrical objects into a box where each corner is marked for a specific color."
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "stack-cylinders-pallet"
    "task-description": "Stack differently sized cylinders onto a pallet, with the largest cylinders at the bottom and the smallest at the top." 
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ball-cylinder-insertion"
    "task-description": "Pick up balls of different sizes and fit them into a cylinder of matching size."
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Answer: I choose Task 2: "stack-cylinders-pallet".

Reason: While there are tasks involving stacking or sorting boxes or blocks, none of them involves stacks of cylinders. This task is sort of similar to the task of stacking blocks into a pyramid but it uses cylinders and a pallet instead of blocks and a stand. It also involves arranging objects in order of size which adds an additional level of complexity.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "color-coded-cylinder-placement",
    "task-description": "Place colored cylinders onto the corresponding colored zones marked on a table surface.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}

Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "precision-box-stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack fixed-sized boxes on a stand ensuring that each box is aligned perfectly with the edges of the box below.",
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}

Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ell-block-organization",
    "task-description": "Organize multiple L-shaped blocks in a container by alternating their orientations in a tessellation pattern.",
    "assets-used": ["insertion/ell.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}

Answer: I choose Task 3: "ell-block-organization".

Reason: This task is innovative because it combines spatial reasoning with precision manipulation. It is distinct from the tasks that involve simple stacking or sorting based on colors and sizes, as it requires the robot to recognize the orientation of the L-shaped blocks and then organize them efficiently in a given space. This tessellation approach differs from placing objects into pre-marked zones or onto stands. It mimics a real-world scenario that could be applied in scenarios where space optimization is critical, such as packing for shipment or arranging components within a machine.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes with a set of default parameters, including the end effector type (`Suction`), the mode (`train`), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`). It also sets up a `PickPlace` primitive, oracle camera configurations, evaluation thresholds for position and rotation (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

### Oracle Agent
The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide perfect actions to accomplish the task. It uses true RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to determine the actions. The oracle agent matches objects to targets and computes the pick and place poses based on the current goals.

### Reward Function and Task Completion Metrics
The `reward` method calculates the delta reward for the current timestep based on the task's metric, which can be either 'pose' or 'zone'. It checks if the objects are correctly matched with their targets or correctly placed within a zone. The `done` method checks if the task is completed or if a certain reward threshold has been reached.

### Environment Helper Functions
The `is_match` function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors. The `get_random_pose` function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

### Helper Functions
The `fill_template` function reads a URDF file template and replaces placeholders with actual values. The `get_random_size` function generates a random size for an object within specified bounds. The `color_random_brown` function assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as inputs and returns the object ID.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: The metric used to evaluate the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the goal of the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "color-coded-cylinder-placement" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-cylinder-placement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where colored cylinders must be placed onto corresponding colored zones. The task uses suction as the end-effector to pick and place the cylinders. The zones and cylinders are added to the environment with random poses, and goals are defined for each cylinder to be placed in the matching color zone. The language goals provide instructions that correspond to the motion goals.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

=========
Now you are asked to generate three new tasks in natural language and choose one of them that you think is the most diverse compared to what is currently available. And briefly explain what your reasons for choosing it are and what is innovative about this task.
In response, you must give your chosen answer at the end, e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.
Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

For example:
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "sort-cylinders-box"
    "task-description": "Sort differently colored cylindrical objects into a box where each corner is marked for a specific color."
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "stack-cylinders-pallet"
    "task-description": "Stack differently sized cylinders onto a pallet, with the largest cylinders at the bottom and the smallest at the top." 
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ball-cylinder-insertion"
    "task-description": "Pick up balls of different sizes and fit them into a cylinder of matching size."
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Answer: I choose Task 2: "stack-cylinders-pallet".

Reason: While there are tasks involving stacking or sorting boxes or blocks, none of them involves stacks of cylinders. This task is sort of similar to the task of stacking blocks into a pyramid but it uses cylinders and a pallet instead of blocks and a stand. It also involves arranging objects in order of size which adds an additional level of complexity.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-height-sorting",
    "task-description": "Arrange a series of cylindrical objects by height from shortest to tallest along a single green line on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}

Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "precision-container-filling",
    "task-description": "Fill a container with small balls, ensuring that no balls are above the rim of the container.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}

Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "bowl-stand-balancing",
    "task-description": "Place a bowl upside down on a stand and then balance a ball on top of the overturned bowl.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}

Answer: I choose Task 3: "bowl-stand-balancing".

Reason: Task 3 presents a challenge that uniquely combines stability, precision, and the unconventional use of a bowl in an inverted position, which is not seen in the current list of tasks. It requires the robot to not only perform precise placement but also to ensure the balance of an object atop an unstable, curved surface. This introduces an innovative aspect of task design that is absent from the existing tasks which primarily focus on sorting, alignment, and stacking.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: This is the base class for tasks, which includes initialization of the task environment, setting up the end effector, defining the workspace bounds, and initializing goals and rewards.

- `reset`: This method resets the task environment and goals.

- `oracle`: This method provides an oracle agent that can calculate the optimal actions to complete the task using perfect knowledge of the environment.

- `reward`: This method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and goals.

- `done`: This method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

- `is_match`: This helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

- `get_random_pose`: This method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

- `get_lang_goal`: This method retrieves the current language goal if available.

- `get_reward`: This method returns the current cumulative reward.

- `fill_template`: This helper function reads a file template and replaces key strings with specified values.

- `get_random_size`: This method returns a random size for an object within specified bounds.

- `color_random_brown`: This method applies a random brown color to an object.

- `add_object`: This method adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following information:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone', including the zone target and size.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with their target poses, independent of the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the simulation code for the "cylinder-height-sorting" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds on the table.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-height-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

In this code, we define a task to sort cylindrical objects by height along a single green line on the tabletop. We use the Suction end-effector because we need to move objects on the Z axis. We add a single green line to the environment as a fixed object and then add a series of cylinders with varying heights. We sort the cylinders by height and define their target poses along the green line, ensuring they are spaced out evenly. Finally, we add a goal to the task that specifies the sorted arrangement of the cylinders as the desired outcome.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

=========
Now you are asked to generate three new tasks in natural language and choose one of them that you think is the most diverse compared to what is currently available. And briefly explain what your reasons for choosing it are and what is innovative about this task.
In response, you must give your chosen answer at the end, e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.
Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

For example:
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "sort-cylinders-box"
    "task-description": "Sort differently colored cylindrical objects into a box where each corner is marked for a specific color."
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "stack-cylinders-pallet"
    "task-description": "Stack differently sized cylinders onto a pallet, with the largest cylinders at the bottom and the smallest at the top." 
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ball-cylinder-insertion"
    "task-description": "Pick up balls of different sizes and fit them into a cylinder of matching size."
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Answer: I choose Task 2: "stack-cylinders-pallet".

Reason: While there are tasks involving stacking or sorting boxes or blocks, none of them involves stacks of cylinders. This task is sort of similar to the task of stacking blocks into a pyramid but it uses cylinders and a pallet instead of blocks and a stand. It also involves arranging objects in order of size which adds an additional level of complexity.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-height-sorting",
    "task-description": "Arrange five cylinders of varying heights but identical diameters onto a line in ascending order of their height.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}

Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "zone-ball-classification",
    "task-description": "Position five balls of distinct colors within their corresponding colored zones on a tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}

Task 3:
{
    "task-name": "pallet-bowl-assembly",
    "task-description": "Place a set of three differently colored bowls in a triangular formation on a pallet, ensuring the colors do not repeat on any side.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}

Answer: I choose Task 3: "pallet-bowl-assembly".

Reason: This task is selected for its novel combination of arranging objects in a formation (triangular) with the added constraint of color diversity. Unlike previous tasks, it integrates the use of color not just for object identification but as a part of the arrangement strategy. Moreover, the task uses bowls, which have not been previously combined with pallets, providing a new challenge in terms of stability and alignment in the simulation.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: This is the base class for tasks, which includes initialization of various parameters such as the end effector (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the pick-and-place primitive (`primitive`). It also defines the workspace bounds, the evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), and the assets root directory.

- `reset`: This method resets the task, clearing goals and progress.

- `oracle`: This method provides an oracle agent that can calculate the perfect action based on the current state of the environment. It uses perfect RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to determine the actions.

- `reward`: This method calculates the delta rewards for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the objects.

- `done`: This method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

- `is_match`: This helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

- `get_random_pose`: This method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

- `get_lang_goal`: This method returns the current language goal.

- `get_reward`: This method returns the current cumulative reward.

- `fill_template`: This helper function reads a file template and replaces key strings with specified values.

- `get_random_size`: This method returns a random size for an object within specified bounds.

- `color_random_brown`: This method applies a random brown color to an object.

- `add_object`: This method in the `Environment` class adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following information:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether each object can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the metric used for the task, such as 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone', including the zone target and size.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.

Understanding these APIs and variables is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-height-sorting" task, as they provide the necessary tools and information to interact with the environment, define the task's goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where five cylinders of varying heights but identical diameters must be sorted and placed onto a line in ascending order of their height. The `CylinderHeightSorting` class inherits from the `Task` base class and uses the `Suction` end-effector to move the cylinders vertically. The task is set up by adding a line to the environment and generating five cylinders with random heights. The cylinders are then sorted by height, and goals are added for each cylinder to be placed at specific target positions on the line that reflect their sorted order. The `step_max_reward` is divided equally among the cylinders, and language goals are provided to describe the placement task for each cylinder.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

=========
Now you are asked to generate three new tasks in natural language and choose one of them that you think is the most diverse compared to what is currently available. And briefly explain what your reasons for choosing it are and what is innovative about this task.
In response, you must give your chosen answer at the end, e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.
Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

For example:
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "sort-cylinders-box"
    "task-description": "Sort differently colored cylindrical objects into a box where each corner is marked for a specific color."
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "stack-cylinders-pallet"
    "task-description": "Stack differently sized cylinders onto a pallet, with the largest cylinders at the bottom and the smallest at the top." 
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ball-cylinder-insertion"
    "task-description": "Pick up balls of different sizes and fit them into a cylinder of matching size."
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Answer: I choose Task 2: "stack-cylinders-pallet".

Reason: While there are tasks involving stacking or sorting boxes or blocks, none of them involves stacks of cylinders. This task is sort of similar to the task of stacking blocks into a pyramid but it uses cylinders and a pallet instead of blocks and a stand. It also involves arranging objects in order of size which adds an additional level of complexity.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-precision-placement",
    "task-description": "Place a set of differently colored cylinders onto corresponding colored lines marked on the tabletop, aligning them perfectly with the lines.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}

Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "bowl-on-pallet",
    "task-description": "Arrange a collection of bowls in a single layer on a pallet, ensuring that each bowl is touching at least one other bowl.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}

Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "cornered-cylinders",
    "task-description": "Pick up cylindrical objects of varying sizes and place them such that one end of each cylinder is touching an L-shaped corner marker on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}

Answer: I choose Task 1: "cylinder-precision-placement".

Reason: This task involves precise alignment which is a common requirement in many manipulation tasks, but it is unique in that it requires aligning cylindrical objects with lines rather than placing them into or onto other objects. While there are tasks involving color matching, this task requires both color matching and precision placement, making it distinct and challenging. It is also feasible and obeys physics, and the use of multiple colors and the shape of the cylinders add to the interest level of the task.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with default parameters such as end-effector type (`Suction`), mode (`train`), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`). It also sets up a pick-and-place primitive, camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can generate perfect actions based on the current state and goals.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified tolerance, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Returns the current language goal or a completion message if the task is done.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random object size within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string that can be either 'pose' or 'zone', defining the type of goal.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing simulation code for the "cylinder-precision-placement" task. The task will involve creating an environment, defining the goals with corresponding objects and target poses, and then using an agent to execute the task based on the defined goals and rewards. The task will be considered complete when all cylinders are placed on the corresponding colored lines with precise alignment.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-precision-placement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where two differently colored cylinders must be placed onto corresponding colored lines with precise alignment. The task uses a Suction end-effector to pick and place the cylinders. The cylinders and lines are added to the environment with specific colors and sizes, and goals are defined for the placement of each cylinder onto its matching line. The language goals provide instructions for the agent to understand the task requirements.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

=========
Now you are asked to generate three new tasks in natural language and choose one of them that you think is the most diverse compared to what is currently available. And briefly explain what your reasons for choosing it are and what is innovative about this task.
In response, you must give your chosen answer at the end, e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.
Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

For example:
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "sort-cylinders-box"
    "task-description": "Sort differently colored cylindrical objects into a box where each corner is marked for a specific color."
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "stack-cylinders-pallet"
    "task-description": "Stack differently sized cylinders onto a pallet, with the largest cylinders at the bottom and the smallest at the top." 
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ball-cylinder-insertion"
    "task-description": "Pick up balls of different sizes and fit them into a cylinder of matching size."
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Answer: I choose Task 2: "stack-cylinders-pallet".

Reason: While there are tasks involving stacking or sorting boxes or blocks, none of them involves stacks of cylinders. This task is sort of similar to the task of stacking blocks into a pyramid but it uses cylinders and a pallet instead of blocks and a stand. It also involves arranging objects in order of size which adds an additional level of complexity.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-cylinder-sequence",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of differently colored cylinders into a sequence inside a bowl from smallest to largest."
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```
Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-pallet-placement",
    "task-description": "Place a series of colored balls onto a pallet, each aligned with its designated colored corner."
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
```
Task 3: 
```python
{
    "task-name": "zone-block-organization",
    "task-description": "Organize colored blocks into their respective colored zones on a tabletop, ensuring each block is fully within its matching zone."
    "assets-used": ["zone/zone.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```
Answer: I choose Task 2: "precision-pallet-placement".

Reason: The precision pallet placement task requires the robot to recognize and match colors between balls and corners of the pallet, as well as to align carefully the balls with specific locations on the pallet. This task stands out because it combines color recognition, precise placement, and spatial reasoning in a novel way that is not covered by the current tasks. It is innovative as it incorporates elements of fine motor skills and coordination, which are crucial for advanced manipulation tasks.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robot simulation tasks.
- It initializes with a suction end effector, a pick-and-place primitive, and default values for various task parameters.
- The `reset` method initializes or resets the task state.
- The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions to complete the task using perfect knowledge of the environment.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified tolerance.
- The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- The `get_lang_goal` method retrieves the current language goal.
- The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.
- The `fill_template` method reads a file and replaces key strings with specified values.
- The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task.
- Each subgoal tuple contains:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
  - `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the evaluation metric for the task.
  - `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes.
  - `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with targets.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions for the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing simulation code that defines and executes tasks within a robot simulation environment. The task's goal is to create a sequence of actions that an agent can follow to accomplish the task objectives while adhering to the constraints of the simulation, such as physics and collision avoidance.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

Please note that the URDF paths for the object and the target marker need to be replaced with the actual paths to the URDF files in your environment. The `get_random_pose` function is used to generate random initial and target positions within the specified workspace bounds. The `add_goal` function sets up the task's objective, which in this case is to move the blue object to the target location. The `Suction` end-effector is chosen because the task may require lifting the object, and the `Suction` gripper is suitable for such operations.

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]

reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

=========
Now you are asked to generate three new tasks in natural language and choose one of them that you think is the most diverse compared to what is currently available. And briefly explain what your reasons for choosing it are and what is innovative about this task.
In response, you must give your chosen answer at the end, e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.
Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

For example:
Task 1:
{
    "task-name": "sort-cylinders-box"
    "task-description": "Sort differently colored cylindrical objects into a box where each corner is marked for a specific color."
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "corner/corner-template.urdf"]
}
Task 2:
{
    "task-name": "stack-cylinders-pallet"
    "task-description": "Stack differently sized cylinders onto a pallet, with the largest cylinders at the bottom and the smallest at the top." 
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Task 3: 
{
    "task-name": "ball-cylinder-insertion"
    "task-description": "Pick up balls of different sizes and fit them into a cylinder of matching size."
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
Answer: I choose Task 2: "stack-cylinders-pallet".

Reason: While there are tasks involving stacking or sorting boxes or blocks, none of them involves stacks of cylinders. This task is sort of similar to the task of stacking blocks into a pyramid but it uses cylinders and a pallet instead of blocks and a stand. It also involves arranging objects in order of size which adds an additional level of complexity.

>>> Answer: 
Task 1:
```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-height-sorting",
    "task-description": "Arrange five cylinders of varying heights in ascending order on a designated line marked on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```
Task 2:
```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-ball-placement",
    "task-description": "Place a set of colored balls into correspondingly colored bowls, ensuring each ball is centered perfectly within the bowl.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```
Task 3:
```python
{
    "task-name": "container-layering",
    "task-description": "Layer different colored blocks in a container, creating a distinct pattern of colors in each layer.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```
Answer: I choose Task 3: "container-layering".

Reason: Task 3 introduces a new concept of layering objects within a container, which adds spatial organization and pattern recognition to the task. Unlike stacking or sorting by size or color alone, this task requires the robot to understand the sequence of color patterns and organize the objects within a confined space. This complexity and the combination of color recognition, pattern formation, and spatial organization make this task diverse compared to the existing ones.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task uses six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the pick-and-place primitive (`primitive`). It also sets up the oracle cameras (`oracle_cams`), evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Oracle Agent
The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide an ideal action sequence for the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

### Reward Function and Task Completion Metrics
The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the goals achieved. The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

### Environment Helper Functions
The `is_match` function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold. The `get_random_pose` function generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.

### Helper Functions
The `fill_template` function reads a file and replaces key strings with specified values. The `get_random_size` function generates a random size for an object within specified bounds. The `color_random_brown` function assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
The `add_object` method allows adding objects to the environment with specified poses and categories (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which object matches which target.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions denoting the goal of the step.

Understanding these components is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-height-sorting" task, which involves arranging cylinders in ascending order based on their height. The task will require setting up the environment, defining the objects and their properties, and implementing the logic for the oracle agent to sort the cylinders correctly.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-height-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All object’s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines the `CylinderHeightSorting` task, which involves sorting cylinders by height along a green line. The task uses the `Suction` end-effector to move the cylinders vertically. The cylinders are created with varying heights and are sorted by their heights to determine the target order. The target poses are calculated so that the cylinders are evenly spaced along the green line. Each cylinder is given a goal to be placed in the correct order, with the reward being distributed equally among the cylinders.
