These tasks already involve sorting objects based on color correspondence. Adding another sorting task with balls instead of cylinders does not significantly increase the diversity or complexity of the task suite. Moreover, the language descriptions and goals in the simulation code are clear and align with the task, but the task itself does not offer a unique challenge compared to existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
