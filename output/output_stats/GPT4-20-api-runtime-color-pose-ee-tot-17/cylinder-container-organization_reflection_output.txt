{'task-name': 'cylinder-container-organization', 'task-description': 'Organize a set of five differently colored and sized cylinders into a container by placing them in ascending order of size from left to right.', 'assets-used': ['container/container-template.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is somewhat similar to 'cylinder-stand-placement' and 'cylinder_precision_placement', which involve organizing cylinders by size and color. However, this task uniquely combines size ordering and spatial arrangement within a container, which is not covered in the current list. It also introduces a new dimension of complexity by requiring the robot to recognize and sort objects based on size, as opposed to just color, and to place them with precision in a confined space. The simulation code correctly implements the task setup and language descriptions, ensuring that the task can be executed and evaluated in the simulation environment.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
