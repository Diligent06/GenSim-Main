{'task-name': 'color-coded-container-filling', 'task-description': 'Pick up and place differently colored cylindrical objects into matching colored containers, ensuring each container contains only its corresponding colored cylinders.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'container/container-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks such as 'color_match_ball_balancing', 'cylinder-array-color-match', and 'precision-ball-placement' as it involves both color matching and precise placement within containers rather than on stands or zones. It also adds the complexity of ensuring that each container only contains cylinders of the corresponding color, which is not covered by any single existing task. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and the language descriptions are clear and consistent with the task objectives.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
