{'task-name': 'color-coded-cylinder-sorting', 'task-description': 'Pick up and sort five differently colored cylinders by placing each of them upright in designated zones marked with matching colors on the table surface.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-sort-stand' and 'cylinder-placement-precision' but with less complexity as it does not require stacking or precision alignment. Additionally, 'color-match-ball-balancing' and 'precision-placement-on-pallet' already involve color matching with placement. The task's language description is clear, and the simulation code appears to achieve the goal, but the task itself does not add significant novelty or complexity to the existing task set.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
