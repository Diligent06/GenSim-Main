{'task-name': 'gradient-tower-balancing', 'task-description': 'Construct a color-gradient tower by sequentially stacking one cylindrical block on top of another from largest to smallest, alternating between placing a ball of a matching color on each cylindrical block, without knocking the tower over.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the 'color-gradient-tower' as it incorporates an additional challenge of balancing balls on the cylinders, which adds complexity and requires precision. However, the task name 'gradient-tower-balancing' may be too similar to the existing 'color-gradient-tower' task, potentially causing confusion. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and language descriptions, but the task implementation must ensure it doesn't overlap in complexity or learning outcomes with 'color-match-ball-balancing' and 'cylinder-tower-balance'.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
