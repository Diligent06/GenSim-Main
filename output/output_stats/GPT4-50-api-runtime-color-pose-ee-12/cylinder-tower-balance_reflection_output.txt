{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-balance', 'task-description': 'Construct a tower by stacking three differently colored cylindrical objects on top of each other on a flat surface of the stand, and then carefully balance a ball on top of the completed tower.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing tasks as it combines precision stacking with an additional challenge of balancing an object on top. It does not overlap with the 'cylinder-array-color-match' or 'cylinder-placement-precision' tasks, as those involve placing cylinders in separate zones rather than stacking and balancing. The simulation code appears to correctly initialize the environment with the necessary objects, define the target poses, and set up the language descriptions for the goals. The task is interesting because it requires a combination of skills, including stacking objects with precision and delicately balancing an object on an unstable structure, which can be beneficial for developing advanced manipulation capabilities in robots.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
