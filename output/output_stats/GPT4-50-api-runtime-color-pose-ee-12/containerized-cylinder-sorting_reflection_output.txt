However, it introduces a new element of placing objects into containers rather than on stands or zones, which adds a different spatial reasoning challenge. The language descriptions are clear and align with the task goals, and the simulation code appears to achieve the intended task setup. However, the novelty might not be sufficient to justify its addition given the existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
