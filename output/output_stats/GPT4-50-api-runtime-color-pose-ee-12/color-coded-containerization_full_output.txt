================= Task and Asset Design!

>>> Prompt: 
You are an AI in robot simulation code and task design. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 

=========
Here are all the assets. Use only these assets in the task and code design.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}
- place-red-in-green: {'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the red blocks and place them into the green bowls amidst other objects.', 'task-name': 'place-red-in-green'}
- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}
- stack-block-pyramid: {'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'sequentially stack 6 blocks into a pyramid of 3-2-1 with rainbow colored ordering.', 'task-name': 'stack-block-pyramid'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task that meets the provided criteria:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-array-color-match",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of differently colored cylinders into corresponding colored zones on the tabletop, ensuring each cylinder stands upright within its matching zone.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

This task is novel because it combines color recognition, precise placement, and spatial reasoning. The challenge lies in the robot's ability to correctly identify the color of each cylinder and place it into a zone with a matching color. Additionally, the requirement for the cylinders to stand upright tests the robot's ability to manipulate objects with precision to avoid toppling them, adding to the task's complexity. The task uses a variety of colors and the asset's cylindrical shape to create an engaging and challenging scenario for tabletop manipulation.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and initializes task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle Agent**: Provides an oracle (perfect) agent that can perform the task without errors, used for demonstrations or testing.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals, and checks if the task is completed.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Includes functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes, and color objects.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
`self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target positions. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, each pose being a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can be matched to any target (True) or if they must be matched uniquely (False).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational component.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, either by matching poses or by placing objects within a specified zone.
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal, independent of the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

The `add_object` function in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the URDF file path, the pose, and the category of the object (fixed, rigid, or deformable) and returns the object ID.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the code for the "cylinder-array-color-match" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds on the table. The task will involve creating subgoals with appropriate matches, target poses, and other parameters as defined in the `self.goals` structure.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-array-color-match".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where the robot must arrange a set of differently colored cylinders into corresponding colored zones on the tabletop. Each cylinder must be placed upright within its matching zone. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick up the cylinders and move them to the zones. The `max_steps` is set to 10, assuming there will be 5 cylinders and 5 zones, providing enough steps to complete the task. The `lang_template` provides a language goal for each cylinder, instructing the robot to place it in the zone of the same color. The `CylinderArrayColorMatch` class inherits from the `Task` class and overrides the `reset` method to set up the task environment with cylinders and zones. The cylinders and zones are added to the environment with random poses and matching colors, and goals are added for each cylinder to be placed in the correct zone. The task description is set to provide information about the number of cylinders to be arranged.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions.

}
```

### Novelty
This task combines color matching with precision placement and stability challenges. The task requires the robot to recognize the color of the cylinders and the corresponding colored zones on the pallet. Each cylinder must be placed upright, which adds to the complexity of the manipulation, as the robot must control the orientation of the cylinder accurately during placement.

### Challenges
- The robot must be capable of picking and handling cylindrical objects, which can roll and are less stable than blocks.
- Precise alignment is needed to place each cylinder upright in the correct zone.
- The robot needs to distinguish between different colors for both the cylinders and the zones, requiring robust color recognition and matching capabilities.
- Balancing the cylinders in an upright position while placing them on the pallet tests the robot's ability to perform delicate manipulation tasks.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the environment class method `add_object`. Here's a summary of my understanding:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment.
- It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (`ee`), mode, six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), a pick and place primitive, and oracle cameras.
- The `reset` method is used to reset the task state.
- The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can calculate the perfect action based on the current state of the environment.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold.
- The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal.
- The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.
- The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file and replace key strings with specified values.
- The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment, specifying the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### `self.goals` Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
  - `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
  - `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
  - `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for implementing the "cylinder-placement-precision" task, as it will involve defining the task's subgoals, setting up the environment, and calculating rewards based on the task's objectives.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where three differently colored cylinders must be placed on corresponding colored zones with precision. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick and place the cylinders. Each cylinder and zone has a unique color, and the goal is to match the cylinder color with the zone color. The task is completed when all cylinders are placed correctly.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
```python
{
    "task-name": "layered-cylinder-stand",
    "task-description": "Stack a set of three differently sized and colored cylinders onto a stand, with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top.",
    "assets-used": ["stacking/stand.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of the task:
- The task "layered-cylinder-stand" is novel because it involves stacking cylinders of different sizes in a specific order, which requires precision in manipulation and an understanding of object sizes for successful completion.
- The challenge lies in the robot's ability to correctly identify the cylinders by size and color, pick them up without toppling over, and carefully place them on the stand in the correct order so they form a stable tower.
- This task involves more colors and shapes as requested, and it is feasible as it obeys the laws of physics. The cylinders will be designed to have diameters that allow them to stack without falling off and their weights will be balanced to avoid toppling.
- Additionally, the task requires the robot to have the capability to perform pick-and-place actions with objects of varying dimensions and to execute fine motor skills to align the cylinders precisely on the stand.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), mode (training), six degrees of freedom (False), and a pick-and-place primitive. It also sets up camera configurations, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, initializing goals, progress, and rewards.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the current goal.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the current goal's completion status. It uses either pose matching or zone intersection to evaluate the task's success.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, which is determined by the goals being empty or the rewards being sufficiently high.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, considering object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal, which is a textual description of the task's current subgoal.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to fill in a URDF template with specific values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the Environment class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their pose and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, how they match with target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the evaluation metric, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the subgoal, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` is a textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "layered-cylinder-stand" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define the task's goals, and evaluate its success.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "layered-cylinder-stand".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a new task description that adheres to the guidelines provided:

```python
{
    "task-name": "sequential-bowl-stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack a series of differently colored bowls into a single tower with descending size order, starting with the largest bowl at the base and the smallest at the top.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of the novelty and challenges:
- The task involves precision stacking of objects with concave shapes (bowls), which adds a level of difficulty not present in stacking solid blocks.
- It requires the robot to recognize and sort the bowls by size and carefully align them to avoid toppling the stack.
- The task combines elements of size differentiation, color recognition (if bowls have different colors), and precision manipulation, which makes it interesting and challenging.
- The task obeys the laws of physics and remains feasible as it involves simple pick-and-place motions with an added constraint on the order of placement.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the task requirements. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, providing an oracle (perfect agent) for demonstrations, calculating rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for interacting with the environment.

The `add_object` function in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, its initial pose, and the category of the object (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses. The dimensions of the matrix are the number of objects by the number of target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, where each pose is a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the task, which can be either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for placing objects within a specified area.
- `params`: A list of parameters relevant to the evaluation metric. For the 'zone' metric, this includes a list of tuples, each containing a zone target pose and zone size.
- `step_max_reward`: A float representing the total reward for completing the subgoal, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

The task requires the objects to obey physics and avoid collisions. The goal poses for the objects must be within the specified workspace bounds above the table. The agent will use the pick-and-place primitive to follow the defined goals and accomplish the task.

If you have any specific requirements or additional information for the "sequential-bowl-stacking" task, please let me know, and I can proceed with writing the simulation code accordingly.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task for stacking bowls in descending size order. The `SequentialBowlStacking` class inherits from the `Task` class and uses the `Suction` end-effector to move the bowls on the Z axis. The task is set up by adding differently colored and sized bowls to the environment and then creating goals for stacking each bowl on top of the larger one below it. The `add_goal` method is used to define the desired end state for each step of the task, with the `step_max_reward` being distributed equally across the number of bowls. The language goal provides a description of the action to be taken at each step, aiding in the alignment of motion goals with language instructions.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task description following your guidelines:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-bowl-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of five differently colored cylinders inside a large bowl, ensuring they are placed upright and ordered by color gradient from the center to the edge.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```

This task is novel because it combines color recognition with precision placement within a confined space. The challenge lies in handling objects with a round base (cylinders) that are prone to rolling, and placing them in a specific order based on color gradient. This requires the robot to have both color detection capabilities and precise control over placing objects without disturbing the already placed ones, adhering to the constraints of physics and feasible tabletop manipulation.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the task requirements. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, providing an oracle (perfect agent) for demonstrations, calculating rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for interacting with the environment.

The `add_object` function is used to add objects to the environment. It takes the URDF file path, the pose (position and orientation), and the category of the object (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, where each pose is a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the task, which can be either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for placing within a general area.
- `params`: A list of parameters that are specific to the 'zone' metric, including the target zone and its size.
- `step_max_reward`: A float representing the total reward for completing the subgoal, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

The task requires the objects to obey physics and avoid collisions. The goal poses must be within the specified workspace bounds above the table. The agent will use the provided pick-and-place primitive to accomplish the task goals as defined by the `self.goals` variable.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the APIs or the task, feel free to ask!

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

# Instantiate the task.
task = CylinderBowlArrangement()
```

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be arranged inside a large bowl. The `CylinderBowlArrangement` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the environment with a bowl and cylinders. The cylinders are placed upright and ordered by color gradient from the center to the edge of the bowl. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move the cylinders vertically. Each cylinder is associated with a goal that specifies its target position within the bowl. The `add_goal` method is called for each cylinder to define the task's objectives, including the language goal for each step.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task description in natural language, along with its novelty and challenges:

Task name: "cylinder-tower-balance"

Task description: "Construct a tower by stacking three differently colored cylindrical objects on top of each other on a flat surface of the stand, and then carefully balance a ball on top of the completed tower."

Assets used: ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]

Explanation of novelty and challenges:
- The task combines elements of both precision stacking and balance.
- Stacking cylindrical objects requires careful alignment and stability control, which is challenging due to the round shape that tends to roll off easily.
- Balancing a ball on top of a stacked cylindrical tower adds to the complexity, as it involves fine-tuning the position to ensure the ball does not fall off.
- The task can be made more challenging by using cylinders of varying diameters and by altering the ball's size to test the robot's ability to adapt to different weights and contact points.

```python
task = {
    "task-name": "cylinder-tower-balance",
    "task-description": "Construct a tower by stacking three differently colored cylindrical objects on top of each other on a flat surface of the stand, and then carefully balance a ball on top of the completed tower.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task.
- It initializes with default values for end-effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, and other task-related parameters.
- The `reset` method is used to reset the task state.
- The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions to complete the task using perfect knowledge of the environment.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- Helper methods like `is_match`, `get_random_pose`, `get_lang_goal`, `get_reward`, `fill_template`, `get_random_size`, and `color_random_brown` are provided for various task-related operations.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment with specified poses and categories (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### self.goals Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
  - `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the type of goal.
  - `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
  - `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "cylinder-tower-balance" task, as they provide the necessary mechanisms to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-tower-balance".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables.

and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must stack three cylinders of different colors on top of a stand and then balance a ball on top of the stacked cylinders. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move objects on the Z axis, which is necessary for stacking. The `max_steps` is set to 8, which is twice the number of goals (4), as recommended. Each cylinder and the ball have their own target pose, and the `add_goal` method is used to define the desired end state for each object. The language goals provide a description of the task for each step, which corresponds to the motion goals.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is the description of a new task which follows the guidelines provided:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-cylinder-sort",
    "task-description": "Sort five cylinders of varying colors into two different colored bowls, ensuring that the bowls only contain cylinders of matching color.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

**Novelty**: This task introduces sorting based on the color of the objects, which adds an element of recognition and decision-making to the robot's task. It also allows the robot to demonstrate precision in placing objects within containers. 

**Challenges**:

1. **Color Recognition**: The robot must be able to distinguish between the colors of different cylinders as well as the bowls.
2. **Dexterity in Manipulation**: The task requires careful handling of cylinders to place them into the correct bowls without knocking over other objects.
3. **Sorting Logic**: The robot needs to employ a sorting algorithm to determine the correct placement of the cylinders based on their color.
4. **Spatial Awareness**: The robot must be aware of the space within the bowls to accurately place the cylinders without causing them to fall out or disrupt the already placed cylinders.

This task is feasible because it only involves pick-and-place actions, which comply with the physical constraints of tabletop manipulation. The task does not require any actions or object interactions that are not supported by the simulation environment, such as using tools or complex hand-eye coordination tasks.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` function for the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. It initializes with default values for various parameters, such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), and whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`). It also sets up a pick-and-place primitive, camera configurations, workspace bounds, and evaluation metrics for pose accuracy.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task state, including goals and progress. The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment, which is useful for demonstrations or testing.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses different metrics, such as pose accuracy or zone coverage, to determine the reward.

The `done` method checks whether the task has been completed or has failed, which is used to determine when an episode ends.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified tolerance, considering both position and rotation (with allowances for symmetrical objects).

The `get_random_pose` helper function generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` and `get_random_size` helper functions are used to generate URDF files with randomized properties and to get random sizes for objects, respectively.

The `color_random_brown` method applies a random brown color to an object, which could be used for visual variety or to simulate different materials.

The `add_object` function in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes a URDF file path, a pose, and a category indicating whether the object is fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved in the subgoal, how they match with target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the metric for success, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the subgoal, and any symmetries the objects may have. The `language_goal` provides a textual description of the subgoal, which could be used for instruction following or natural language processing tasks.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for implementing the "bowl-cylinder-sort" task, as it will involve setting up the environment, defining the goals and subgoals, and calculating rewards based on the successful sorting of cylinders into the correct bowls.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "bowl-cylinder-sort".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

        # If the colors do not match, the task description would need to specify how to sort them.
```

This code defines a task where the robot must sort five cylinders of varying colors into two different colored bowls. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the cylinders vertically. The bowls are added to the environment with fixed positions and colors, and the cylinders are added with random positions. Goals are defined for each cylinder to be sorted into a bowl with a matching color, and a language goal is provided for each sorting action. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1/n_cylinders` to distribute the reward evenly across the cylinders.

For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and assets provided, here's a new task that incorporates color, shape, and feasible tabletop manipulation challenges:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-sort-stand",
    "task-description": "Sort five differently colored cylinders by stacking them on a stand in a specific color order from bottom to top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty and Challenges:
- This task involves both sorting and precise stacking, combining elements of organization and delicate manipulation.
- The use of cylinders adds a challenge in maintaining balance during the stacking process.
- The specific color order requirement tests the robot's ability to recognize colors and sequence items accordingly.
- Stacking cylinders on a stand will require fine control of the robot's end-effector to align the objects vertically.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the environment class method `add_object`. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end-effector (suction), mode (training), six degrees of freedom (False), and other task-related settings. The `reset` method is used to reset the task state, and the `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly for demonstration purposes.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, considering object symmetries. The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method is a utility for reading a file template and replacing key strings with specified values. The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds, and the `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments and returns the object ID.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the metric used for the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for writing the code for the "cylinder-sort-stand" task, as it will involve manipulating these elements to define the task's goals, rewards, and completion criteria.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-sort-stand".

and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be sorted and stacked on a stand in a specific color order from bottom to top. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the cylinders vertically. Each cylinder is added to the environment with a random pose and a specific color. The target poses for the cylinders are calculated based on their position on the stand, and goals are added for each cylinder to be placed in the correct order. The `step_max_reward` is divided equally among the cylinders to ensure that the agent is rewarded incrementally for each correct placement.

Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task described in natural language, ensuring it meets the criteria you've specified:

```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-bowl-stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack a set of three different colored bowls inside each other without toppling, starting with the largest at the bottom and ending with the smallest on top.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty and Challenges:
- This task introduces a stacking challenge that is different from block stacking. Bowls have curved surfaces, making it more challenging to balance them when stacked.
- The task requires delicate manipulation and precise control to successfully nest the bowls without causing them to fall.
- The task considers the physical properties and constraints of the bowls, which must obey real-world physics. The robot has to perform careful alignment and speed control.
- The use of different colored bowls adds complexity in identifying the correct order of stacking from largest to smallest.
- It is a feasible tabletop manipulation task that tests the robot's ability to handle objects with varying curvature and stability.

Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the task requirements. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, providing an oracle (perfect agent) for demonstrations, calculating rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for interacting with the environment.

Key components of the `Task` class include:

- `reset(self, env)`: Resets the task to an initial state.
- `oracle(self, env)`: Provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly for demonstration purposes.
- `reward(self)`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the agent's actions.
- `done(self)`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(self, pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering object symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(self, env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal(self)`: Returns the current language goal or a completion message if the task is done.
- `get_reward(self)`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(self, template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(self, min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(self, obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` function in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, its pose, and its category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: Additional parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instruction describing the subgoal.

The task "precision-bowl-stacking" will require careful consideration of these APIs to ensure that the robot can stack the bowls in the correct order without collisions and within the bounds of the workspace. The task will be considered complete when all bowls are stacked correctly, and the agent will receive rewards based on the accuracy of the stacking.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

# Instantiate the task
task = PrecisionBowlStacking()
```

This code defines a task for stacking three bowls of different sizes and colors. The `PrecisionBowlStacking` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment by adding three bowls with random initial poses. The target poses for the bowls are calculated so that they stack inside each other, with the largest bowl at the bottom. The `Suction` end-effector is used because the task requires moving objects on the Z axis. Goals are added for each bowl to be stacked in the correct order, and the task is completed when all bowls are stacked correctly.

Do you think your task is sufficently interesting to be added as a new task for future task given that we already have the following task name and descriptions? Moreover, does the simulation code achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task? Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

Reminder:
your task:

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the given assets and guidelines, here's a new task described in natural language:

**Task Name:** "precision-placement-on-pallet"

**Task Description:** "Place a series of differently colored cylinders on specific locations on a pallet, matching the cylinder colors to the designated zone colors, ensuring each cylinder is upright and precisely aligned within its zone."

**Assets Used:** ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]

**Novelty and Challenges:** This task involves precision placement, color matching, and spatial reasoning. The novelty comes from the combination of using cylinders, which are prone to rolling, with the requirement for precise placement on specific zones on a pallet, also incorporating color matching. The challenge is in carefully manipulating each cylinder to stand upright in its designated zone without knocking over other cylinders or misaligning them. This task tests the robot's dexterity, stability control, and visual perception accuracy.

Here is the dictionary formatted as requested:

```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-placement-on-pallet",
    "task-description": "Place a series of differently colored cylinders on specific locations on a pallet, matching the cylinder colors to the designated zone colors, ensuring each cylinder is upright and precisely aligned within its zone.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: A base class for tasks that includes initialization of the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, primitive actions, oracle cameras, evaluation metrics, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

- `reset`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.

- `oracle`: Provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

- `reward`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's metric (either 'pose' or 'zone') and updates the task's progress and rewards.

- `done`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed based on the remaining goals and the cumulative rewards.

- `is_match`: Determines if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, taking into account object symmetries.

- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

- `fill_template`: Reads a URDF file template and replaces placeholders with specific values to generate a temporary URDF file for an object.

- `get_random_size`: Returns a random size for an object within specified bounds.

- `color_random_brown`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

- `add_object`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that need to be manipulated.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects correspond to which target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string ('pose' or 'zone') specifying the type of goal metric for the task.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone', including the target pose and size of the zone.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A low-level language instruction describing the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs and variables is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "precision-placement-on-pallet" task, as they provide the necessary mechanisms to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where the robot must place differently colored cylinders on matching colored zones on a pallet. The task uses a Suction end-effector to pick and place the cylinders. Each cylinder and its corresponding zone have a unique color, and the robot must match the cylinder color to the zone color. The task is completed when all cylinders are placed on the correct zones on the pallet.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
{
 "task-name": "bowl-cylinder-tower",
 "task-description": "Stack three differently colored cylinders within a bowl without toppling, then place a differently colored ball on top of the cylinder tower.",
 "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}

Explanation:
The "bowl-cylinder-tower" task introduces the challenge of precision stacking within a constrained space. The novelty lies in combining the careful stacking of cylinders, which requires dexterity and balance, with the additional challenge of placing a ball on the unstable tower, necessitating delicate manipulation and fine motor control. The task emphasizes stability, stacking skills, and the use of different colors to distinguish between the cylinders and the final ball. The constrained environment of the bowl will make it more difficult to correctly place and balance the cylinders, adding to the task's complexity.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with a set of default parameters, including the end effector type (`Suction`), mode (`train`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the pick-and-place primitive to be used. It also sets up the oracle cameras, evaluation metrics for pose accuracy, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, clearing goals and progress.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. This agent is used to demonstrate how the task should be completed.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses different metrics (`pose` or `zone`) to evaluate the success of the actions taken by the agent.

The `done` method checks whether the task has been completed or has failed.

The `is_match` helper function checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a URDF file template and replace placeholders with actual values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their URDF file, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved in the subgoal, how they match with target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the metric for success, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the subgoal, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides a textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "bowl-cylinder-tower" task, as they provide the necessary functions and methods to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "bowl-cylinder-tower".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines the "bowl-cylinder-tower" task, where the goal is to stack three differently colored cylinders within a bowl and then place a differently colored ball on top of the cylinder tower. The `Suction` end-effector is used to move objects on the Z axis. The task is set up by adding the bowl, cylinders, and ball to the environment with random poses. The target poses for the cylinders and the ball are defined relative to the bowl's pose. Goals are added for each cylinder and the ball, with corresponding language goals. The `step_max_reward` is set to 1/4 for each goal since there are four goals in total.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task described in natural language, ensuring its novelty and challenges while using the provided assets:

```
{
    "task-name": "sequential-bowl-pyramid",
    "task-description": "Stack three differently colored bowls in ascending size order to form an inverted pyramid on the pallet, then place a differently colored ball on top of the smallest bowl without toppling the structure.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of Novelty and Challenges:
- **Novelty**: This task combines elements of precision stacking with balance. Unlike the typical block stacking, it uses bowls, which have a curved interior that adds difficulty in placing the ball without it rolling off.
- **Challenges**: The task requires careful alignment and balance to ensure the bowls do not topple when stacked in an inverted manner. Additionally, placing the ball on top of the smallest bowl without disturbing the pyramid involves precise control and stability. The different colors of the bowls and ball add a requirement for recognition and sorting based on visual features.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

- `Task`: A base class for tasks that includes initialization of the environment, reward function, task completion metrics, and helper functions for environment manipulation.
- `reset`: Resets the task environment and initializes goals and progress.
- `oracle`: Provides an oracle agent that can calculate the optimal action based on perfect knowledge of the environment.
- `reward`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the agent's performance.
- `done`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match`: Determines if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors.
- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal`: Retrieves the current language goal if available.
- `get_reward`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template`: Fills a template file with specified values and returns the path to the temporary file.
- `get_random_size`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown`: Applies a random brown color to an object.
- `add_object`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that need to be manipulated.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects correspond to which target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric, either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for a general area.
- `params`: Additional parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions for the current subgoal.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the simulation code for the "sequential-bowl-pyramid" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics and do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "sequential-bowl-pyramid".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where three bowls of different colors and sizes are stacked in ascending order to form an inverted pyramid on a pallet. A ball is then placed on top of the smallest bowl. The task uses the Suction end-effector to move objects on the Z axis. The `SequentialBowlPyramid` class inherits from the `Task` base class and defines the task-specific reset method, which adds the objects to the environment and sets up the goals for the task. The target poses for the bowls are calculated based on the pallet's pose and the sizes of the bowls. The `add_goal` method is used to define the goals for stacking the bowls and placing the ball, with language goals provided for each step. The `max_steps` parameter is set to twice the number of goals to provide enough steps to complete the task.

reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the given assets and guidelines, here is a new tabletop manipulation task described in natural language:

The task involves sorting a series of colored balls by placing them onto matching colored cylindrical stands. The robot has to identify the color of each ball and match it to a cylinder of the same color. The balls and cylinders will be randomly placed on the tabletop at the beginning of the task, and the robot must move the balls without dropping them.

To increase the complexity and diversity of the tasks, each cylinder could have a small platform on top of which the ball must be balanced, adding a requirement for precision in placement. The challenge comes from the need for color recognition, precise control to balance the balls, and careful manipulation to avoid knocking the cylinders over.

Here is the task in the required dictionary format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "color-match-ball-balancing",
    "task-description": "Identify the color of each ball, then pick and place it onto a matching colored cylindrical stand with a small platform, ensuring each ball remains balanced on top.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

This task is novel because it requires both color matching and precision balancing, which were not combined in the given examples. It also obeys the laws of physics and is feasible given the manipulation capabilities of typical robotic arms.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector (suction), training mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) setting, pick and place primitive, and oracle camera configurations. It also sets evaluation thresholds for position and rotation, workspace bounds, and initializes variables for goals, language goals, progress, rewards, and asset root directory.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task, clearing goals and progress. The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment, which is useful for demonstrations or testing.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment. It uses either pose matching or zone intersection to evaluate the task's progress.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, which is determined by whether all goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors, as well as object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method retrieves the current language goal, which provides a textual description of the task's current goal.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method is a utility for reading a file template and replacing key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method is part of the `Environment` class and is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their URDF, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved in the task, how they match with target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are considered, the metric for evaluating the task, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for completing the step, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides a textual description of the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "color-match-ball-balancing" task, as they provide the necessary methods and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where two balls must be placed on matching colored stands. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick up the balls and place them on the stands. The task is completed when each ball is balanced on the stand of the same color. The `add_goal` method is called for each ball-stand pair, with a language goal describing the action to be taken.

Do you think your task is sufficently interesting to be added as a new task for future task given that we already have the following task name and descriptions? Moreover, does the simulation code achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task? Be as rigorous and high-standard as possible.

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a new task designed according to the guidelines and constraints provided:

```python
{
    "task-name": "color-coded-container-organization",
    "task-description": "Pick up five differently colored cylinders and place them upright into five matching colored zones within a single large container, maintaining spatial separation between each cylinder.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty:
- The task involves the precise placement of objects within a confined space (a large container), which adds an element of spatial reasoning.
- It reinforces color matching skills by associating cylinders with matching colored zones.
- The task requires careful manipulation to maintain spatial separation between the cylinders, ensuring that they do not topple or touch each other.

Challenges:
- Precision in both color matching and spatial arrangement within the container.
- Gentle handling of the cylinders to keep them upright during placement.
- The robot must be careful not to disturb the already placed cylinders while inserting new ones, which involves planning the order of placement and the trajectory of movement.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` function in the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, providing an oracle (perfect agent) for demonstrations, calculating rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for manipulating the environment and objects within it.

Key attributes and methods include:

- `ee`: The end effector used for the task, in this case, a suction gripper.
- `mode`: The mode of the task, which can be 'train' or 'test'.
- `sixdof`: A boolean indicating if the task allows six degrees of freedom.
- `primitive`: The action primitive used for the task, here it is `PickPlace`.
- `oracle_cams`: Configuration for oracle cameras.
- `pos_eps` and `rot_eps`: Positional and rotational thresholds for evaluating if an object is correctly placed.
- `bounds`: The workspace bounds within which the task takes place.
- `zone_bounds`: Specific bounds for placement zones.
- `goals`: A list of subgoals for the task, each represented as an 8-tuple.
- `lang_goals`: Language-based goals corresponding to the subgoals.
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment.
- `oracle(env)`: Provides an oracle agent for the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Retrieves the current language-based goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specific values.
- `get_random_size(...)`: Generates a random size for an object.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` function in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the object's URDF file, its pose, and the category (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of subgoals for the task, where each subgoal is an 8-tuple containing:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or just one.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: The evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instruction for the subgoal.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the code for the "color-coded-container-organization" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-container-organization".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be placed into matching colored zones within a single large container. The task uses a Suction gripper to move the cylinders on the Z axis. Each cylinder and zone is added to the environment with a random pose, ensuring that the zones are within the bounds of the container. The `add_goal` method is used to specify the task's goals, with a language goal provided for each cylinder. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1 / n_objects` to distribute the reward evenly across the placement of all cylinders.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a new task described in natural language, detailing its novelty and challenges:

```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-jenga",
    "task-description": "Carefully extract and reposition a single randomly colored block from the lower layers without toppling the tower of multicolored blocks stacked in a jenga-like fashion on a pallet.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty:
- This task is unique as it combines the concept of a palletizing task with the precision and delicacy required in a game of Jenga.
- It requires the robot to identify a block that can be moved without causing the structure to collapse, which involves strategic decision-making and physical reasoning.
- The task allows for a dynamic environment where each action can significantly alter the state of the system, requiring continual reassessment and adaptation.

Challenges:
- The robot will have to execute fine manipulative skills to grasp and extract a block without disturbing the stability of the remaining structure.
- Visual perception will be necessary to identify feasible blocks that can be moved and to ensure they are repositioned accurately on top of the stack.
- The task has an element of variability, as block colors are randomly assigned, necessitating color identification and possibly pattern recognition to determine the best block to move next.

This task aligns with the guidelines given in the prompt by making use of existing assets, introducing a task that requires both cognitive and physical capabilities, allowing for an element of randomness (block colors), and ensuring that the task is physically feasible within the constraints of a tabletop manipulation scenario.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, primitive actions, camera configurations, and workspace bounds.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly for demonstration or testing purposes.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Provides additional utility functions such as filling templates with data and generating random sizes or colors for objects.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
`self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targ_poses)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, each represented as a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can match with multiple targets (`True`) or if each target is unique to an object (`False`).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational component.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, either by matching object poses (`pose`) or by measuring object intersection with a zone (`zone`).
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A string providing a low-level language instruction describing the goal of the current step.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

Understanding these APIs is crucial for implementing the "pallet-jenga" task, as they provide the necessary tools to manipulate objects within the simulation, evaluate the agent's performance, and progress through the task's goals. The task will involve creating a stack of blocks on a pallet and then executing actions to remove and reposition blocks without toppling the stack, all while adhering to the physics constraints of the simulation environment.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "pallet-jenga".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines the "pallet-jenga" task for a robot simulation environment. The task involves moving a single block from a jenga-like tower on a pallet to a target zone without toppling the tower. The `PalletJenga` class inherits from the `Task` class and sets up the task environment, including the pallet, the blocks, and the target zone. It uses the `Suction` end-effector to pick and place blocks. The `reset` method is responsible for initializing the task environment for each new episode. It randomly selects one of the lower blocks to be moved and defines a target zone for the block to be placed. The `add_goal` method is used to specify the task's goal state, which includes the object to be moved, its target pose, and a language goal describing the task.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a description of a new task, designed with the guidelines and constraints you provided:

```python
{
    "task-name": "bowl-precision-stacking",
    "task-description": "Stack two bowls of different colors on top of each other on a flat surface, with a green ball placed inside the bottom bowl before stacking the second bowl, ensuring the ball does not roll out during the process.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

**Novelty**: 
The task combines precise stacking with the additional challenge of handling a ball that has the potential to roll away. It requires the robot to delicately place the ball and carefully maneuver the second bowl over the ball without disturbing it.

**Challenges**:
1. Precision in handling - The robot must place the ball exactly in the center of the bottom bowl to prevent it from rolling when covered with the second bowl.
2. Stability - The robot must ensure that the bowls are stacked neatly to prevent them from toppling over, which could also dislodge the ball.
3. Sensing - The robot needs adequate sensing to make sure the ball remains inside the bottom bowl while the top bowl is being placed.
4. Decision-making - The robot might need to adjust the green ball¡¯s position if it is not exactly in the center before stacking the second bowl.

This task is both feasible and abides by the physics of the simulation environment. It involves objects of different shapes and colors and requires a combination of steady manipulation and precise control.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` method for the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

### Task Class
- The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment.
- It initializes with default values for the end effector (`ee`), mode, six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), a pick and place primitive (`primitive`), and oracle cameras (`oracle_cams`).
- The `reset` method is used to reset the task, initializing goals, language goals, progress, and rewards.
- The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task.
- The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold.
- The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal or a task completion description.
- The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.
- The `fill_template` method is a utility to read a file and replace key strings with specified values.
- The `get_random_size` method returns a random size for a box within specified bounds.
- The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- The `add_object` method is used to add objects to the environment. It takes the URDF file path, pose, and category of the object (fixed, rigid, or deformable) and returns the object ID.

### self.goals Variable
- `self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains:
  - `objs`: A list of object IDs.
  - `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
  - `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
  - `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with one unique target or multiple targets.
  - `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
  - `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric ('pose' or 'zone').
  - `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
  - `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
  - `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
  - `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

Understanding these APIs and the structure of the `Task` class is crucial for writing simulation code for robotic tasks, as it allows for the creation of tasks that are both challenging and achievable within the constraints of the simulation environment.

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-tower-precision",
    "task-description": "Construct a tower by precisely stacking a sequence of five differently colored boxes on top of each other on a designated zone on a pallet, with the requirement that each box aligns exactly with the edges of the box below.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

This task is novel because it combines palletizing with precision stacking and alignment. The challenge lies in the precise manipulation needed to align the boxes' edges, which requires careful control of the robot's movements. The use of multiple colors adds to the task's complexity in terms of visual processing and decision-making for the robot. The task obeys physics and is feasible as it involves only stacking actions, which are well within the capabilities of tabletop manipulation robots.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulated environment. It initializes with a suction end effector, a pick-and-place primitive, and other task-related parameters such as workspace bounds and evaluation metrics.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, initializing goals and other task-related variables.

The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the task goals.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the current state of the environment. It uses the goals defined in `self.goals` to determine if the task is being completed correctly.

The `done` method checks if the task has been completed or if a failure condition has been met.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified tolerance, considering both position and rotation.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal, which is a textual description of the task's current subgoal.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward for the task.

The `fill_template` method is a utility function to fill a URDF template with specific values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment, specifying their URDF, pose, and category.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric, either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for placing within a zone.
- `params`: A list of parameters for the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A textual description of the subgoal for language-based instructions.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "pallet-tower-precision" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment and define the task logic.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines the "pallet-tower-precision" task, where the robot must stack five differently colored boxes on a designated zone on a pallet. The task uses the Suction end-effector to move the boxes on the Z axis. Each box has a specific target pose that aligns with the edges of the box below it. The `add_goal` method is used to define the desired final state for each box, and the language goal provides a textual description of the task for each step. The `max_steps` is set to 10 to provide enough steps to complete the task, assuming two steps per box (pick and place).

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided guidelines and previous tasks, here's a new task for tabletop manipulation:

```python
{
    "task-name": "color-coded-container-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of five colored boxes inside a single container, with the boxes' colors matching the sequence of colored lines drawn inside the container.",
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of the task's novelty and challenges:
- **Novelty**: This task combines the precision placement of boxes with color matching and sequence arrangement inside a container. Unlike previous tasks, this task requires the robot to both identify the color of the boxes and the sequence of the lines inside the container, which adds a layer of complexity.
- **Challenges**: The robot must accurately pick and place boxes of specific colors in the correct sequence, matching the color of the lines drawn inside the container. Precision is key, as misalignment may prevent all boxes from fitting properly. Additionally, the robot has to maneuver within the confined space of the container, which requires careful manipulation skills.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly using privileged information.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Includes functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes, and change object colors.

### `self.goals` Variable:
- **objs (List of obj_id)**: Contains object IDs that are involved in the task.
- **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating the correspondence between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: Specifies the target poses for the objects, each pose being a tuple of translation and rotation.
- **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can be matched to targets non-uniquely (`True`) or if each target can only be matched with one object (`False`).
- **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational component.
- **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, which can be based on the pose of the objects or their location within a specified zone.
- **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: If the metric is `zone`, this list contains tuples of zone targets and sizes.
- **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current step of the task, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- **symmetries**: The angle in radians around the z-axis for which the object is symmetric, affecting how pose matching is evaluated.
- **language_goal**: A string providing a low-level language instruction describing the goal of the current step.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying their URDF, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The task "color-coded-container-arrangement" will require the robot to identify the color of the boxes and arrange them in a sequence that matches the colored lines inside the container. The task will be completed in multiple steps, each with its own subgoal, and the robot will use the pick and place primitive to move the objects according to the goals defined. The objects must be placed within the specified workspace bounds and must not collide with each other. The task will be evaluated based on the robot's ability to match the objects to the target poses or zones, and rewards will be given based on the accuracy of the placements.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-container-arrangement".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines a task where a robot must arrange five colored boxes inside a container, matching the sequence of colored lines drawn inside the container. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the boxes on the Z axis. The container and lines are added to the environment with specific poses and colors, and the boxes are randomly placed in the environment. Goals are added for each box to be placed on the corresponding colored line, with language goals describing the action to be taken. The `max_steps` is set to 10 to allow for the arrangement of the boxes and potential adjustments.

I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate tasks and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design diverse and feasible tasks for tabletop manipulation. I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it.

=========
Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- cylinder_placement_precision: {'task-name': 'cylinder-placement-precision', 'task-description': 'Pick up a set of three differently colored cylinders and place them standing upright on corresponding colored zones on a pallet, with precision alignment required.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf']}
- manipulating-rope: {'assets-used': ['square/square-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'rearrange a deformable rope such that it connects the two endpoints of a 3-sided square.', 'task-name': 'manipulating-rope'}
- place-red-in-green: {'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the red blocks and place them into the green bowls amidst other objects.', 'task-name': 'place-red-in-green'}
- bowl_precision_stacking: {'task-name': 'bowl-precision-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack two bowls of different colors on top of each other on a flat surface, with a green ball placed inside the bottom bowl before stacking the second bowl, ensuring the ball does not roll out during the process.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf']}
- precision-bowl-stacking: {'task-name': 'precision-bowl-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack a set of three different colored bowls inside each other without toppling, starting with the largest at the bottom and ending with the smallest on top.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf']}
- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}
- stack-block-pyramid: {'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'task-description': 'sequentially stack 6 blocks into a pyramid of 3-2-1 with rainbow colored ordering.', 'task-name': 'stack-block-pyramid'}
- bowl-precision-stacking: {'task-name': 'bowl-precision-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack two bowls of different colors on top of each other on a flat surface, with a green ball placed inside the bottom bowl before stacking the second bowl, ensuring the ball does not roll out during the process.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf']}
- palletizing-boxes: {'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'box/box-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up homogeneous fixed-sized boxes and stack them in transposed layers on the pallet.', 'task-name': 'palletizing-boxes'}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and guidelines, here's a novel task described in natural language, ensuring its feasibility and adherence to physics:

```python
{
    "task-name": "color-block-tower",
    "task-description": "Create a stable tower by stacking a red cylinder, a green block, and a blue ball in sequence on a flat surface.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/block.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of Novelty and Challenges:
- This task combines assets of different shapes¡ªcylinders, blocks, and balls¡ªrequiring the robot to adapt its manipulation strategy for each item.
- The variety of colors specified for each shape adds a recognition challenge, ensuring the robot must correctly identify and select the items.
- Stacking a ball on top of other objects introduces a challenge in balance and precision, as the ball will tend to roll off if not perfectly centered.
- The task tests the robot's ability to plan and execute a sequence of actions that result in a stable structure.
- Creating a tower with these specific items is a new combination that has not been explored in the previously listed tasks and does not overlap with existing tasks.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulation environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, primitive actions, camera configurations, and workspace bounds.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the current task state.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Provides additional utility functions such as filling templates with data, generating random sizes, and coloring objects.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
`self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, each represented as a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether objects can match with multiple targets (`True`) or if they must match uniquely (`False`).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational component.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, which can be either pose matching or zone coverage.
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Parameters for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
9. **symmetries**: The angle in radians around the z-axis for which the object is symmetric.
10. **language_goal**: A string providing a low-level language instruction describing the goal of the current step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the code for the "color-block-tower" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds on the table. The task will be designed to be accomplished by an agent using pick-and-place primitives following the defined goals.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-block-tower".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "color-block-tower" in python code block starting with ```python.  Reminder: {'task-name': 'color-block-tower', 'task-description': 'Create a stable tower by stacking a red cylinder, a green block, and a blue ball in sequence on a flat surface.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf']}

```

This code defines a task where a robot must stack a red cylinder, a green block, and a blue ball in sequence to form a tower. The `Suction` end-effector is used because the objects need to be moved vertically. The `max_steps` is set to 6, which is twice the number of goals, to give the robot enough steps to complete the task. The `lang_template` provides a language goal for each step, guiding the robot to stack the objects in the correct order. The `add_goal` function is used to define the desired end state for each object, with `step_max_reward` set to 1 for each goal since there is only one goal per object. The target poses are calculated based on the initial pose of the cylinder and the sizes of the objects, ensuring that each object is placed directly on top of the previous one.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a new task description based on the provided guidelines:

```python
{
    "task-name": "precision-ball-placement",
    "task-description": "Carefully place a set of three different colored balls into the corresponding colored bowls, ensuring that each bowl contains only the matching colored ball.",
    "assets-used": ["bowl/bowl.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty and Challenges:
- This task emphasizes precision in placing balls into bowls.
- It requires color recognition and fine manipulation to ensure that balls are placed into the correct bowls without displacing others.
- The challenge increases with the addition of more balls and bowls, requiring careful planning and execution.
- The task is physically feasible and obeys the laws of physics, as it involves simple pick-and-place actions.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the task requirements for "precision-ball-placement". Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It initializes with a set of default parameters, including the end effector type (`Suction`), the mode (`train`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the primitive action type (`PickPlace`). It also defines the workspace bounds, the evaluation metrics for pose accuracy, and the assets root directory, which must be set before the task can be reset.

The `reset` method is used to initialize or reset the task environment. It clears the goals and progress and sets the cumulative rewards to zero.

The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly. It uses perfect RGB-D orthographic images and segmentation masks to calculate the actions required to complete the task. The oracle agent follows a series of steps to match objects to their targets and execute pick-and-place actions.

The `reward` method calculates the delta rewards for the current timestep based on the task's progress and the current goal step. It uses either pose matching or zone intersection to evaluate the task's success and updates the cumulative rewards accordingly.

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed. It returns `True` if the task goals have been achieved or if the rewards exceed a certain threshold.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified translational and rotational threshold, taking into account any symmetries around the z-axis.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method reads a URDF file template and replaces key strings with specified values to generate a temporary file for the simulation.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for a box within specified minimum and maximum dimensions.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation environment. It loads the URDF file for the object and places it at the specified pose.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains information about the objects, their matches with target poses, whether objects can be replaced, whether rotations are allowed, the evaluation metric, parameters for zone evaluation, the maximum reward for the step, and symmetries for pose matching.

The `language_goal` variable contains low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the simulation code for the "precision-ball-placement" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "precision-ball-placement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code sets up the "precision-ball-placement" task, where three colored balls must be placed into corresponding colored bowls. The task uses a Suction end-effector to pick up and place the balls. The environment is reset with randomized ball colors and fixed bowl positions. Goals are added for each ball to be placed in the matching colored bowl, with language goals describing the task. The `max_steps` is set to twice the number of goals to provide enough steps to complete the task.

================= TRIAL: 20

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new tabletop manipulation task that abides by the constraints and guidelines provided:

```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-ring-tower",
    "task-description": "Construct a tower by stacking three rings of decreasing sizes onto a cylindrical stand, with the largest ring at the bottom and the smallest at the top, then cap the tower with a ball, all positioned on a designated pallet zone.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "stacking/stand.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty and Challenges:
- This task introduces the concept of precision stacking with rings (cylinders without tops) in a descending size order, which requires the robot to carefully align and balance the rings on the stand.
- The added challenge of capping the stacked rings with a ball tests the robot's dexterity and steadiness, as placing the ball on the uneven surface of the rings can be difficult.
- The task requires the robot to work within a confined space, the designated pallet zone, which demands accurate placement of the objects.
- The use of multiple colors and shapes (rings, a stand, a ball, and a pallet zone) adds to the complexity of the task in terms of object recognition and manipulation.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base for defining robotic manipulation tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the `Task` Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, primitive actions, camera configurations, and workspace bounds.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the current task state.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current task state and the progress towards the goal.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Add Object**: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### Understanding `self.goals`:
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses**: A list of target poses, where each pose is a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace**: A boolean indicating whether objects can be matched to targets uniquely or not.
5. **rotations**: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
6. **metric**: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the subgoal, either 'pose' for specific poses or 'zone' for areas.
7. **params**: Additional parameters relevant to the metric, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
8. **step_max_reward**: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal, independent of the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the code for the "pallet-ring-tower" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds on the table. The task will involve defining the subgoals, setting up the environment, and ensuring that the agent can execute the pick-and-place actions to accomplish the task.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "pallet-ring-tower".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables.

and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.
- precision-bowl-stacking: {'task-name': 'precision-bowl-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack a set of three different colored bowls inside each other without toppling, starting with the largest at the bottom and ending with the smallest on top.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf']}

- align-box-corner: {'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'corner/corner-template.urdf'], 'task-description': 'pick up the randomly sized box and align one of its corners to the L-shaped marker on the tabletop..', 'task-name': 'align-box-corner'}
- pallet-ring-tower: {'task-name': 'pallet-ring-tower', 'task-description': 'Construct a tower by stacking three rings of decreasing sizes onto a cylindrical stand, with the largest ring at the bottom and the smallest at the top, then cap the tower with a ball, all positioned on a designated pallet zone.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf']}
- bowl_precision_stacking: {'task-name': 'bowl-precision-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack two bowls of different colors on top of each other on a flat surface, with a green ball placed inside the bottom bowl before stacking the second bowl, ensuring the ball does not roll out during the process.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf']}
- precision-ball-placement: {'task-name': 'precision-ball-placement', 'task-description': 'Carefully place a set of three different colored balls into the corresponding colored bowls, ensuring that each bowl contains only the matching colored ball.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf']}
- sweeping-piles: {'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'block/small.urdf'], 'task-description': 'push piles of small objects into a target goal zone marked on the tabletop.', 'task-name': 'sweeping-piles'}
- cylinder-array-color-match: {'task-name': 'cylinder-array-color-match', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of differently colored cylinders into corresponding colored zones on the tabletop, ensuring each cylinder stands upright within its matching zone.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf']}

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a new task designed according to your guidelines:

```python
{
    "task-name": "multi-level-box-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a set of boxes, each with a unique color, into a multi-level structure on the tabletop, where each level corresponds to a specific color indicated by colored zones, with the largest boxes forming the base level and the smallest at the top.",
    "assets-used": ["box/box-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

The novelty of this task lies in its requirement to arrange boxes not only by color but also by size in a multi-level structure, which introduces considerations of balance and precision in stacking. The challenges include:

1. **Color Matching**: The robot has to identify boxes by their color and match them to the corresponding colored zones on the tabletop.
2. **Size Grading**: The robot must be able to distinguish between different sizes of boxes and stack them from largest to smallest.
3. **Structural Stability**: As the boxes are stacked into a multi-level structure, the robot needs to ensure that the boxes are placed in a stable manner to prevent the structure from collapsing.
4. **Spatial Reasoning**: Successfully completing the task requires the robot to plan and execute an arrangement that spatially accommodates the boxes within the defined zones.
5. **Manipulation Skills**: The task involves complex manipulation skills, such as careful placement to avoid knocking over already stacked boxes.

This task requires the robot to demonstrate advanced perception, planning, and manipulation capabilities, making it a comprehensive and challenging tabletop manipulation task.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes various parameters such as the end effector (`ee`), the mode of operation (`mode`), whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), the pick and place primitive (`primitive`), and the oracle cameras (`oracle_cams`). It also sets up evaluation metrics (`pos_eps` and `rot_eps`), workspace bounds (`bounds` and `zone_bounds`), and other task-related variables.

### Task Methods
- `reset(env)`: Resets the task environment.
- `oracle(env)`: Defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task.
- `reward()`: Calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the task's goals and progress.
- `done()`: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- `is_match(pose0, pose1, symmetry)`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering symmetry.
- `get_random_pose(env, obj_size)`: Generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal()`: Retrieves the current language goal.
- `get_reward()`: Returns the current cumulative reward.
- `fill_template(template, replace)`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z)`: Generates a random size for a box within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown(obj)`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object(urdf, pose, category)`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether objects can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: A string indicating the evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for each object.
- `language_goal`: The low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "multi-level-box-arrangement" task, as they provide the necessary functions and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "multi-level-box-arrangement" in python code block starting with ```python.  Reminder: {'task-name': 'multi-level-box-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of boxes, each with a unique color, into a multi-level structure on the tabletop, where each level corresponds to a specific color indicated by colored zones, with the largest boxes forming the base level and the smallest at the top.', 'assets-used': ['box/box-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf']}

```

This code defines a task where boxes of different sizes and colors are arranged into a multi-level structure, with each level having a specific color indicated by colored zones. The task uses the Suction end-effector to move the boxes vertically and place them in the correct zones. Each box has a unique target zone, and the reward is distributed equally across all the boxes. The language goals provide instructions for where each box should be placed.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and the assets available, I've created a new task with its description and list of assets used. Below is the task formatted as a Python dictionary:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cascade-cylinder-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange a series of five differently colored cylinders in ascending order of height along a single green line, ensuring each cylinder is upright and touches the line with its base.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```

This task focuses on color recognition, precise placement, and an understanding of size gradation, with the added challenge of maintaining alignment on a straight path. The novelty of this task comes from the combination of arranging objects in a specific sequence based on their size along a designated path, which requires the robot to have fine control over positioning and orientation.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `self.goals` variable. Here's a summary:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulation environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, providing an oracle (perfect agent) for demonstrations, calculating rewards, checking task completion, and various helper functions for interacting with the environment.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. `objs`: A list of object IDs (`obj_id`) that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. `matches`: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target positions. The dimensions of the matrix are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, where each pose is a tuple containing a translation vector `[x, y, z]` and a rotation quaternion `[q0, q1, q2, q3]`.
4. `replace`: A boolean indicating whether an object can match with multiple targets (`True`) or if each object can only match with one unique target (`False`).
5. `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
6. `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the subgoal, which can be either `'pose'` for precise placement or `'zone'` for placing objects within a specified area.
7. `params`: A list of parameters relevant to the metric. For the `'zone'` metric, this would include a list of tuples, each containing a zone target pose and zone size.
8. `step_max_reward`: A float representing the maximum reward for completing the subgoal. This reward is not dependent on the number of objects but on the number of goals.
9. `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects involved in the subgoal.
10. `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

The `add_object` function in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the URDF file path, the pose of the object, and the category of the object (fixed, rigid, or deformable) as arguments.

The task requires careful consideration of the physics and collision avoidance between objects. The goal poses for the objects must be within the specified workspace bounds above the table. The agent will use the provided pick-and-place primitive to accomplish the task based on the defined goals.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cascade-cylinder-arrangement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Now write the code for the task "cascade-cylinder-arrangement" in python code block starting with ```python.

```

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be arranged in ascending order of height along a single green line. The `CascadeCylinderArrangement` class inherits from `Task` and sets up the environment with a green line and cylinders. The cylinders are added with increasing heights and must be placed on specific target positions along the line. The `Suction` end-effector is used to pick and place the cylinders vertically. Each cylinder has a corresponding language goal that describes its placement in the arrangement. The `add_goal` method is called for each cylinder to define its target pose and the conditions for successful placement.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]

reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",

reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.

- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and the guidelines, here's a new task described in natural language, along with its novelty and challenges:

Task Name: "Pallet Tower Sorting"
Task Description: "Sort colored blocks by stacking them onto designated color-matched zones on a pallet, creating towers without toppling, and maintaining a specific order of colors."
Assets Used: ["stacking/block.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]

Novelty:
The "Pallet Tower Sorting" task introduces the challenge of precision stacking on a pallet, which is a common task in warehouse settings. The combination of color matching and ordered stacking adds complexity to the task. The requirement to build towers on a pallet without them toppling over introduces an element of stability and precision.

Challenges:
1. Precision in Placement: Robots must delicately place blocks onto specific zones of the pallet, matching the color of the block to the color of the zone.
2. Order of Colors: The task requires maintaining a specific sequence of colors in the stack, which tests the robot's ability to plan and execute the task considering future moves.
3. Stability of Towers: The blocks must be stacked in such a way as to avoid toppling, necessitating careful consideration of the weight distribution and balance.
4. Multiple Object Management: The robot will need to handle multiple objects simultaneously, optimizing the stacking process to reduce the time and movement needed to complete the task.

Python Dictionary Representation:
```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-tower-sorting",
    "task-description": "Sort colored blocks by stacking them onto designated color-matched zones on a pallet, creating towers without toppling, and maintaining a specific order of colors.",
    "assets-used": ["stacking/block.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of the key components:

### Task Class
The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining a robotic task. It initializes various parameters and methods that are essential for setting up the environment, defining the goals, and evaluating the task's progress and completion.

### Key Attributes and Methods
- `ee`: End effector type, e.g., `Suction`.
- `mode`: The mode of the task, e.g., 'train'.
- `sixdof`: A boolean indicating if the task allows six degrees of freedom.
- `primitive`: The action primitive used, e.g., `PickPlace()`.
- `oracle_cams`: Configuration for oracle cameras.
- `pos_eps` and `rot_eps`: Position and rotation thresholds for evaluating if a pose matches a target.
- `bounds`: Workspace bounds for the task.
- `zone_bounds`: Specific bounds for the zones within the workspace.
- `goals`: A list of goals for the task, each goal being an 8-tuple.
- `lang_goals`: Language-based goals for the task.
- `progress`: A metric indicating the progress of the task.
- `assets_root`: The root directory for assets like URDF files.

### Oracle Agent
The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide an optimal action sequence for the task. It uses perfect knowledge of the environment to determine the best pick and place actions.

### Reward Function and Task Completion Metrics
- `reward`: A method to calculate the delta rewards for the current timestep based on the task's goals and the current state of the environment.
- `done`: A method to check if the task is completed or has failed.

### Environment Helper Functions
- `is_match`: Checks if two poses match within a specified threshold.
- `get_random_pose`: Generates a random collision-free pose within the workspace bounds.
- `get_lang_goal`: Retrieves the current language-based goal.
- `get_reward`: Returns the current cumulative reward.

### Helper Functions
- `fill_template`: Fills a template file with specified values.
- `get_random_size`: Generates a random size for an object within specified bounds.
- `color_random_brown`: Assigns a random brown color to an object.

### Environment Class
- `add_object`: Adds an object to the environment with a specified pose and category.

### self.goals Variable
The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step pick-and-place task. The components of the tuple are as follows:
- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each consisting of a translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating if objects can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating if the placement action includes rotation.
- `metric`: The evaluation metric, either 'pose' or 'zone'.
- `params`: Additional parameters, such as zone targets and sizes if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the subgoal.
- `symmetries`: The symmetry of the objects around the z-axis in radians.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions describing the subgoal.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the simulation code for the "pallet-tower-sorting" task, as they provide the necessary mechanisms to interact with the environment, define task goals, and evaluate task performance.

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

This code defines a task where colored blocks are sorted by stacking them onto designated color-matched zones on a pallet. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move the blocks vertically and place them accurately. Each block has a corresponding zone on the pallet with a matching color, and the goal is to stack each block on its matching zone. The `add_goal` method is called for each block to define the sorting task's goals, with the target pose being directly above the corresponding zone on the pallet. The `step_max_reward` is divided equally among the blocks to ensure that the reward is distributed based on the number of blocks successfully placed. The `primitive` is set to `push` as a placeholder, although the Suction end-effector is used for the task.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the provided assets and guidelines, here's a new task designed to be both feasible and challenging:

```python
{
    "task-name": "color-coded-cylinder-arrangement",
    "task-description": "Arrange five differently colored cylinders into a specific sequence on the table, making sure they match the predetermined color pattern and are standing upright without falling.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
```

Explanation of the task's novelty and challenges:
- **Novelty**: This task combines color recognition with precision placement, requiring the robot to not only identify the colors but also to arrange objects in a sequence. Unlike stacking or inserting, arranging in a line introduces a new spatial arrangement challenge.
- **Challenges**: The task involves careful manipulation to ensure the cylinders stand upright and do not topple while being placed. The robot must also accurately recognize colors and understand the sequence, which adds complexity in terms of sensor processing and decision making. Using a line as a reference for alignment adds another layer of precision to the task.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the task requirements. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining a robotic task in a simulated environment. It includes methods for resetting the task, providing an oracle (perfect) agent for demonstrations, calculating rewards, and checking task completion. It also includes helper functions for environment interaction and object manipulation.

The `add_object` function in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation. It takes the URDF file path, the pose (position and orientation), and the category of the object (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects can be matched with which target poses. The dimensions are the number of objects by the number of target poses.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, where each pose is a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether an object can match with multiple targets or only one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string that specifies the evaluation metric for the task, which can be either 'pose' for precise placement or 'zone' for placing within a general area.
- `params`: A list of parameters for the 'zone' metric, including the target zone and its size.
- `step_max_reward`: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- `symmetries`: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
- `language_goal`: A string providing low-level language instructions describing the goal of the current step.

The task "color-coded-cylinder-arrangement" will require the robot to identify and arrange cylinders according to a specific color sequence. The task will be evaluated based on the robot's ability to match the cylinders to the target poses within the specified bounds and without collisions. The task will be considered complete when all cylinders are arranged correctly, and the robot will receive rewards based on its performance at each step.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-cylinder-arrangement".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

# parameter set to True to allow each cylinder to be placed in any target pose.
```

This code defines a task where five differently colored cylinders must be arranged in a specific sequence on a table. The task uses a suction end-effector to pick and place the cylinders. The cylinders are placed along a green line that indicates the correct sequence. Each cylinder has a goal associated with it, specifying where it should be placed. The language goal provides a description for each step, guiding the robot to place the cylinders in the correct order.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and assets provided, I have conceptualized a new task that involves precision, planning, and shape recognition. Here's the description in the requested format:

```python
{
    "task-name": "containerized-cylinder-sorting",
    "task-description": "Pick up five cylinders of different colors and sizes and place each one into a corresponding container marked with a matching color outline on the tabletop.",
    "assets-used": ["container/container-template.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf"]
}
```

Novelty: This task introduces a color and size matching challenge that requires fine manipulation skills to place cylinders of varying sizes into containers with matching color outlines. This tests the robot's ability to recognize and match colors accurately, handle objects of different sizes, and precisely align them with the corresponding container outlines.

Challenges: The task is challenging due to the requirement for precise alignment of the cylinders with the container outlines, which may be of varying sizes and require adjustments in grip and placement strategy. The color recognition adds another layer of complexity, necessitating a clear visual system for differentiation. The feasibility of the task rests on the robot's ability to gauge the size of each cylinder and match it with the correct container, all while managing the physical constraints of alignment and placement within a confined area.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the Task Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can generate expert actions for the current observation.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the task's goals.
- **Done**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helper Functions**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Contains functions to fill templates with data, get random sizes, and color objects.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
- **objs (List of obj_id)**: Contains object IDs that are involved in the task.
- **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating which objects correspond to which target positions. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
- **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: Specifies the target poses for each object, including translation and rotation as tuples.
- **replace (Boolean)**: Determines if objects can be matched to targets uniquely or if multiple objects can match the same target.
- **rotations (Boolean)**: Indicates if the placement action includes a rotational component.
- **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: Specifies the type of metric used to evaluate the task, either by matching poses or by being within a specified zone.
- **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: Provides details for each zone, including the target pose and size, if the metric is `zone`.
- **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing a step in the task, which is independent of the number of objects but depends on the number of goals.
- **symmetries**: Specifies the rotational symmetry of the object around the z-axis in radians.
- **language_goal**: Contains low-level language instructions that describe the goal of the current step.

### Environment Class:
- **add_object**: A method to add objects to the environment, specifying the object's URDF file, pose, and category (fixed, rigid, or deformable).

### Task Constraints:
- Objects must obey physics and avoid collisions.
- Object goal poses must be within the specified workspace bounds above the table.
- Multiple subgoals may be present for multi-step pick-and-place tasks.
- An agent with pick-and-place capabilities will execute the task according to the defined goals.

Understanding these components is crucial for implementing the "containerized-cylinder-sorting" task, as it will involve setting up the environment, defining the goals and subgoals, and ensuring that the agent can execute the task with the provided primitives and constraints.

================= Code Generation!

Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "containerized-cylinder-sorting".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

Here are some tasks that you have come up with before. Try to learn from these structures but avoid overlapping with these tasks. For instance, `bowl_ball_placement` and `sort_balls_in_bowls` are the same task. `pile_boxes_in_corner` and `stack_blocks_into_pallet` are similar tasks, `align-cylinder-in-corner` and `align-cylinder-corner` are similar.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Based on the guidelines and previous examples you've provided, here's a new task description in natural language:

Task Name: "pallet-tower-challenge"

Task Description: "Build a tower by stacking one blue cylinder and two red boxes alternately on a single pallet, ensuring that the cylinder rests on the bottom and is capped by the boxes with the final structure remaining stable."

Assets Used: ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]

This task is novel because it involves a combination of different shapes (cylinders and boxes) and colors (blue and red), which introduces the challenge of balancing different geometries on top of each other. It requires precision in placement to maintain the stability of the tower and integrates color-based sorting as part of the task.

Here's the formatted task description in a Python dictionary:

```python
{
    "task-name": "pallet-tower-challenge",
    "task-description": "Build a tower by stacking one blue cylinder and two red boxes alternately on a single pallet, ensuring that the cylinder rests on the bottom and is capped by the boxes with the final structure remaining stable.",
    "assets-used": ["pallet/pallet.urdf", "cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, which serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks in a simulated environment. Here's a summary of the key components and the `self.goals` variable:

### Key Components of the Task Class:
- **Initialization**: Sets up the end effector type, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) flag, pick and place primitive, oracle cameras, evaluation thresholds, workspace bounds, and other task-related variables.
- **Reset**: Resets the task state and initializes goals and progress.
- **Oracle**: Provides an oracle agent that can perform the task perfectly using privileged information.
- **Reward Function**: Calculates the reward based on the current state and the goals.
- **Task Completion**: Checks if the task is completed or has failed.
- **Environment Helpers**: Includes functions to check if poses match, get random collision-free poses, and other utility functions.
- **Helper Functions**: Provides additional utility functions such as filling templates with data, generating random sizes, and changing object colors.

### The `self.goals` Variable:
`self.goals` is a list of 8-tuples, each representing a subgoal in a multi-step task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

1. **objs (List of obj_id)**: A list of object IDs that are involved in the current subgoal.
2. **matches (Binary Matrix)**: A binary matrix indicating potential matches between objects and target poses. The dimensions are `len(objs)` by `len(targs)`.
3. **targ_poses (List of Poses)**: A list of target poses, each represented as a tuple of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (quaternion q0, q1, q2, q3).
4. **replace (Boolean)**: Indicates whether an object can match with multiple targets (`True`) or if it should match with a unique target (`False`).
5. **rotations (Boolean)**: Specifies whether the placement action includes a rotational degree of freedom.
6. **metric (`pose` or `zone`)**: The metric used to evaluate the task, which can be either 'pose' (matching object poses to target poses) or 'zone' (placing objects within a specified zone).
7. **params (List of (zone_target, zone_size))**: If the metric is 'zone', this is a list of tuples, each containing a zone target pose and size.
8. **step_max_reward (float)**: The maximum reward for completing the current subgoal.
9. **symmetries**: The radians of rotational symmetry around the z-axis for the objects.
10. **language_goal**: A string providing a low-level language instruction describing the subgoal.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the code for the "pallet-tower-challenge" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics, do not collide, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds. The task will involve defining the appropriate subgoals, setting up the environment, and ensuring that the agent can execute the task using the pick and place primitive.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "pallet-tower-challenge".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

This code defines the "pallet-tower-challenge" task, where the robot must stack a blue cylinder and two red boxes on a pallet. The task uses a Suction end-effector to move objects on the Z axis. The `reset` method adds the pallet, cylinder, and boxes to the environment with random poses. It then defines target poses for the cylinder and boxes on the pallet and adds three goals corresponding to placing each object in its target pose. The `step_max_reward` is divided equally among the three goals.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here is a description of a new task in natural language, considering the guidelines and constraints provided:

Task Name: "Cylinder-Pallet-Maze"
Task Description: "Create a maze pathway on the tabletop using colored cylinders, leading to a specific zone on the pallet, then navigate a ball through the maze to rest within that zone without disturbing the cylinder arrangement."
Assets Used: ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]

This task is novel because it combines the concepts of navigation, precision, and spatial reasoning within the constraints of tabletop manipulation. It challenges the robot to carefully maneuver through restricted spaces defined by the cylinder maze. The novelty lies in constructing the maze itself and then navigating through it, which requires both strategic planning and delicate control. The task also incorporates elements of color recognition if the cylinders and zones are color-coded, adding an additional layer of complexity.

Here is the dictionary format for the new task:

```python
{
    "task-name": "cylinder-pallet-maze",
    "task-description": "Create a maze pathway on the tabletop using colored cylinders, leading to a specific zone on the pallet, then navigate a ball through the maze to rest within that zone without disturbing the cylinder arrangement.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "pallet/pallet.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "zone/zone.urdf"]
}
```

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and their functionalities. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class serves as a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with default parameters for the end effector, mode, six degrees of freedom (DoF) capability, a pick-and-place primitive, and camera configurations. It also sets evaluation thresholds for position and rotation, workspace bounds, and initializes variables for goals, language goals, progress, rewards, and asset root directory.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task environment, and it requires that the `assets_root` be set to locate the assets needed for the task.

The `oracle` method provides an oracle agent that can generate actions based on perfect knowledge of the environment. It uses segmentation masks and heightmaps to determine the best pick and place actions to achieve the goals.

The `reward` method calculates the delta rewards for the current timestep based on the current goal step, which can be evaluated either by matching object poses (`pose` metric) or by measuring object intersection with a zone (`zone` metric).

The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed, based on whether all goals have been achieved or if the cumulative rewards exceed a certain threshold.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors, as well as object symmetries.

The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `get_lang_goal` method returns the current language goal or a completion message if all language goals have been achieved.

The `get_reward` method returns the current cumulative reward.

The `fill_template` method reads a file and replaces key strings with specified values.

The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for a box within specified bounds.

The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the `Environment` class is used to add objects to the environment, specifying whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains information about the objects involved, the target poses, whether objects can match with multiple targets, whether rotations are considered, the metric for evaluation, parameters specific to the metric, the maximum reward for the step, and the symmetries of the objects. The `language_goal` provides a low-level language instruction for the step.

Understanding these APIs is crucial for writing the code for the "cylinder-pallet-maze" task, as they provide the necessary methods and properties to interact with the simulation environment, define the task's goals, and evaluate the agent's performance.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "cylinder-pallet-maze".

"""



Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

=========
Here are some bad example task instances with explanations.
{
    "task_name": "sort-color-blocks",
    "task_descriptions": "Pick up differently colored blocks and place them into separate bowls of matching color."
    "assets-used": ["bowl.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf],
}
reasons: not interesting because it overlaps with the current task `put-block-in-bowl`.

{
    "task-name": "guided-ball-maze",
    "task-description": "Navigate a small ball through a maze by tilting the maze board to reach the target zone.",
    "assets-used": ["zone-template.urdf", "square-template.urdf", "ball.urdf", "maze.urdf"],
}
reasons: the language descriptions are too ambiguous. Navigation is also hard to complete. Also maze.urf does not exist.

{
    "task-name": "insert_cylinder_in_sphere",
    "task-description": "Pick up the cylinder and insert it into the sphere with an opening on top.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "sphere/sphere-template.urdf"],
}
reasons: this task does not make sense. The sphere does not have an opening on top, and you cannot insert a cylinder into a sphere. Similarly tasks like `insert-ball-into-cylinder` and `cylinder-box-insertion` are invalid.

{
    "task-name": "ball-box-obstacle-course",
    "task-description": "Navigate a ball through an obstacle course created by randomly placed boxes and finally place it inside a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Navigate the ball is not related to tabletop manipulation tasks.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-box",
    "task-description": "Use a cable to guide a ball into an open box.",
    "assets-used": ["cable/cable.urdf", "ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: This task is too hard since it involves interaction of the cable and the ball and cannot be easily completed.

{
    "task-name": "ball-in-container",
    "task-description": "Use the spatula to lift a ball over a wall of boxes and drop it into a container.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: The only action primitives as pick and place. One cannot use a spatula to lift an object.

{
    "task-name": "line-ball-sorting",
    "task-description": "Move balls of different colors along a single green line, placing each ball in a designated colored box at the end of the line. The challenge includes precision in maintaining the ball on the line and the correct identification of the box color corresponding to each ball.",
    "assets-used": ["ball/ball-template.urdf", "box/box-template.urdf", "line/single-green-line-template.urdf"]
}
reasons: Piling or stacking balls are physically infeasible in the simulation.



=========
Now please describe the new task in natural languages and explain its novelty and challenges. Format the answer in a python dictionary with keys "task-name" and value type string, "task-description" (one specific sentence) and value type string, and "assets-used" and value type list of strings. Note that

- Do not use assets that are not in the list above. 
- Tasks that have more colors and shapes are interesting.
- Be as specific as possible about the number, shape, and color of each asset in the task descriptions. 
- The task need to obey physics and remain feasible.





>>> Answer: 
Here's a description of a new task designed within the given constraints:

```python
{
    "task-name": "color-coded-containerization",
    "task-description": "Arrange four differently colored cylinders into a container, ensuring each cylinder is placed vertically and in the color order from left to right as red, green, blue, and yellow.",
    "assets-used": ["cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf", "container/container-template.urdf"]
}
```

This task is novel because it combines the challenges of precise object placement, color recognition, and order sequencing. The task's novelty lies in the requirement to arrange the cylinders in a specific color order, which adds complexity in terms of both planning the manipulation sequence and validating the final arrangement.

The challenges include:
- **Precision manipulation**: Each cylinder must be placed vertically within the container, which requires careful handling and placement by the robot.
- **Color recognition and sorting**: The robot must identify each cylinder's color and place it in the correct sequence.
- **Spatial reasoning**: The task requires the robot to arrange the cylinders in a left-to-right order within a confined space, which involves spatial planning to ensure all cylinders fit without knocking each other over.

This task obeys the laws of physics and is feasible within a tabletop manipulation simulation environment, provided that the robot has the necessary perception and manipulation capabilities.

=========
Note that the objects need to obey physics and not collide with each other, and the object goal poses need to be above the table with lower bound x=0.25, y=-0.5 and upper bound x=0.75, y=0.5. When there are multiple objects for a multi-step pick-and-place task, there are often multiple subgoals. Once the task and environment are generated, an agent with a pick and place primitive will follow the defined goal to accomplish the tasks. 

Additionally, make sure you understand and summarize the ``self.goals`` variables, which has a list of 8-tuple with (objs, matches, targ_poses, replace, rotations, metric, params, step_max_reward, symmetries).
- objs (List of obj_id): object ID.
- matches (Binary Matrix): a binary matrix that denotes which object is matched with which target. This matrix has dimension len(objs) x len(targs).
- targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation). 
- replace (Boolean): whether each object can match with one unique target. This is important if we have one target and multiple objects. If it's set to be false, then any object matching with the target will satisfy.
- rotations (Boolean): whether the placement action has a rotation degree of freedom. 
- metric (`pose` or `zone`): `pose` or `zone` that the object needs to be transported to. Example: `pose`. 
- params (List of (zone_target, zone_size)): a list of (zone_target, zone_size) for each zone if the metric is `zone`. 
- step_max_reward (float): the total reward of matching all the objects with all the target poses. It is not dependent on the number of objects but dependent on the number of goals. 
- symmetries: the radians that the object is symmetric around z axis.
- language_goal: the low-level language instructions that denote the goal of this step.
 


>>> Answer: 
I understand the provided APIs and the structure of the `Task` class, as well as the `add_object` method in the environment class. Here's a summary of my understanding:

The `Task` class is a base class for defining robotic tasks. It initializes with default values for various parameters, such as the end effector type (`ee`), the mode, whether the task allows six degrees of freedom (`sixdof`), and the pick-and-place primitive to be used. It also sets up the workspace bounds, the evaluation metrics (position and rotation epsilons), and placeholders for goals and language goals.

The `reset` method is used to reset the task, initializing the goals and progress metrics. The `oracle` method defines an oracle agent that can provide perfect actions to complete the task, using an idealized perception of the environment.

The `reward` method calculates the reward for the current timestep based on the current goal step, which can be evaluated based on pose or zone metrics. The `done` method checks if the task is completed or has failed.

The `is_match` method checks if two poses match within a specified threshold, considering translational and rotational errors, as well as object symmetries. The `get_random_pose` method generates a random collision-free pose for an object within the workspace bounds.

The `fill_template` method is a utility for reading a file template and replacing key strings with specified values. The `get_random_size` method generates a random size for an object within specified bounds. The `color_random_brown` method assigns a random brown color to an object.

The `add_object` method in the environment class is used to add objects to the simulation, specifying their URDF file, pose, and whether they are fixed, rigid, or deformable.

The `self.goals` variable is a list of 8-tuples that define the subgoals for a multi-step pick-and-place task. Each tuple contains the following elements:

- `objs`: A list of object IDs.
- `matches`: A binary matrix indicating which objects are matched with which targets.
- `targ_poses`: A list of target poses, each a tuple of translation and rotation.
- `replace`: A boolean indicating whether each object can match with one unique target.
- `rotations`: A boolean indicating whether the placement action includes a rotation degree of freedom.
- `metric`: A string indicating the metric used for the task ('pose' or 'zone').
- `params`: A list of parameters for each zone if the metric is 'zone'.
- `step_max_reward`: The total reward for matching all objects with all target poses.
- `symmetries`: The radians of symmetry around the z-axis for the object.
- `language_goal`: Low-level language instructions that denote the goal of the current step.

With this understanding, I can proceed to write the code for the "color-coded-containerization" task, ensuring that the objects obey physics and do not collide with each other, and that the goal poses are within the specified bounds.

================= Code Generation!

>>> Prompt: 
Now I will provide you some reference code and you can write the code for the task "color-coded-containerization".

Do not use libraries, functions, and assets that you don't know. For each object, try to describe its color, size, category in the task first before you write the code. You do not need extra helper functions. Comment the code liberally to explain what each piece does and why it's written that way. If you have only one goal, `step_max_reward` in `add_goal` should be 1. Use functions `make_piles` and `make_ropes` for creating piles and cables. To use spatula together with the push primitives, import the libraries 
"""
from cliport.tasks import primitives;
from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula
"""
and then use `self.primitive = primitives.push` and `self.ee = Spatula`.
Note that the number of language goals usually match the number of motion goals, since they should correspond to each other.

Before generate code, you have a few considerations to focus on:
1. You are strictly prohibited from using function interfaces that do not appear in the above sample code. For example, the module cliport.tasks.primitives does not have pick_plack or place functions, only the push function interface is available.
2. Module 'cliport.tasks.primitives' has no attribute 'pick_place', you mustn't use it.
3. There are two types of your Gripper, one is Spatula and the other is Suction.You need to choose a different end-effector depending on your task requirements. If you need to move an object on the Z axis, then you need to use the Suction type. If you just need to translate an object in a 2D plane, then you can use either Spatula or Suction type.
4. You must determine the type of end-effector you need to use based on the type of task you have. You can choose by adding self.ee=Spatula or self.ee=Suction to the __init__(self) function, the default self.ee is Suction.
5. If you want to use Suction, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Suction". Else if you want to use Spatula, you must import module using "from cliport.tasks.grippers import Spatula".
6. The x-coordinate of the object is in the range [0.25, 0.75], the y-coordinate is in the range [-0.5,0.5] and the z-coordinate is in the range [0, 0.3].
7. The initial position of all objects needs to get its random initial position through the get_random_pose function.
8. The self.max_steps parameter value should be greater than the number of calls to self.add_goal, and preferably equal to twice the number of calls to self.add_goal. For example, if you call self.add_goal twice in one task, then self.max_steps is better set to 4.

If you want to generate the color of the object, you have to obey following rules:
1. You must use the utils.COLORS['COLOR_NAME'] function interface to generate an RGB three-channel value for a color.
2. The available colors for 'COLOR_NAME' are blue, red, green, orange, yellow, purple, pink, cyan, brown, white, gray, indigo, violet, black, silver and gold.
3. If you want to generate a red object, then its RGB three-channel color can be obtained through utils.COLORS['red'].
All objectâ€™s colors generation must follow color generation method above.

If you want to generate the target pose of the object(third parameter of function 'self.add_goal' targ_poses), you have to obey following rules:
1. The target pose of an object is represented by the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the object and its orientation quaternion.
2. The target pose of an object must be represented by [(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)]. Where (x,y,z) are the three-dimensional coordinates of the object and (q1,q2,q3,q4) denote the quaternions of the object's target pose.
3. The target pose of an object must be generated by you or use the initial pose of an object as the target pose of the current object.
4. Here's an example, to generate the target pose of a Y object, we have the initial pose information of an X object. So target pose of Y can be represented by pose_y=[(x,y,z),(q1,q2,q3,q4)] or pose_y=initial_pose_x.(Where x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4 are specific values.)
5. targ_poses (List of Poses [(translation [x,y,z], rotation [q0,q1,q2,q3])] ): a list of target poses of tuple (translation, rotation).
6. The targ_poses you generate must contain translation[x,y,z], but rotation[q0,q1,q2,q3] you may or may not generate.
All object's target pose generation must follow method above.

```

In this code, we define a task called `ColorCodedContainerization` that inherits from the `Task` class. The task involves placing four cylinders of different colors into a container in a specific order. We use the `Suction` end-effector because we need to move objects vertically. We define the colors and their order, add a container to the environment, and then add four cylinders with the specified colors. We calculate the target poses for each cylinder to be placed inside the container and add goals for each cylinder placement. The `step_max_reward` is set to `1 / len(cylinders)` to distribute the reward evenly across the placements.
