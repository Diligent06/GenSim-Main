{'task-name': 'precision-bowl-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack a set of three different colored bowls inside each other without toppling, starting with the largest at the bottom and ending with the smallest on top.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the other stacking tasks in the current list, which focus on blocks, cylinders, and boxes. The challenge of stacking bowls of varying sizes inside each other without toppling adds a unique precision element to the task. The simulation code correctly sets up the environment, defines the bowls, their colors, and sizes, and adds goals with appropriate language descriptions for each step of the task. The task also makes use of the Suction gripper, which is suitable for handling bowls.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
