{'task-name': 'cylinder-pallet-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort a mixture of red and green cylinders onto two separate pallets, arranging each color on its corresponding colored pallet while ensuring the cylinders remain upright.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the current tasks as it involves sorting cylinders based on color onto separate pallets, which combines elements of color sorting and precise placement. However, the task may be considered too simple since it only involves two cylinders, and the task list already includes 'cylinder-sort-stand' and 'cylinder_array_color_match' which are similar in theme but potentially more complex.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
