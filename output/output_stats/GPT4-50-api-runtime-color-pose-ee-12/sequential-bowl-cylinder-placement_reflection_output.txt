{'task-name': 'sequential-bowl-cylinder-placement', 'task-description': 'Place a series of five colored cylinders into bowls of the same color sequentially, starting with the smallest cylinder and ending with the largest, ensuring each cylinder stands upright in the bowl.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks in the current list. While there are tasks involving color matching and placing objects into or onto other objects, this task uniquely combines sequential placement with color matching and size differentiation, which could be beneficial for training manipulation agents on tasks that require careful planning and execution in a specific order. Additionally, the task's language descriptions are clear and aligned with the goals set in the code, making it suitable for language-conditioned learning.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
