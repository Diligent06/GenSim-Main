{'task-name': 'cylinder-precision-alignment', 'task-description': 'Align a sequence of five differently colored cylinders on a straight green line, ensuring each cylinder stands vertically and is centered on the line with consistent spacing.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'line/single-green-line-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks such as 'cylinder-sort-stand', 'cylinder-array-color-match', and 'cylinder-placement-precision' as it introduces a unique challenge of aligning objects in a straight line with precision, which is not covered by the other tasks. Additionally, the task description and language goals are clear, and the simulation code appears to correctly implement the task objectives and language descriptions. However, the code snippet provided does not include the implementation of 'additional_reset' method, which is called in the '__init__' method, and it's unclear how the consistent spacing between the cylinders is enforced or checked in the task. Assuming 'additional_reset' is correctly implemented and the consistent spacing is appropriately handled, the task could be a valuable addition to the task list.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
