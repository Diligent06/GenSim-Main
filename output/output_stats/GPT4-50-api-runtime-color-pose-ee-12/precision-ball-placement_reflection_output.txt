{'task-name': 'precision-ball-placement', 'task-description': 'Carefully place a set of three different colored balls into the corresponding colored bowls, ensuring that each bowl contains only the matching colored ball.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'bowl_precision_stacking' and 'color-coded-container-arrangement' in terms of color matching and precision placement, but it introduces a unique challenge by requiring the placement of round objects (balls) into containers (bowls) which can roll away, adding an element of precision control that is not covered by the other tasks. Additionally, the task uses language goals for each ball, which aligns with the language grounding objectives of the system. However, the task might be considered less complex compared to tasks that require stacking or constructing structures.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
