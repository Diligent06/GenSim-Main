{'task-name': 'cylinder-array-color-match', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of differently colored cylinders into corresponding colored zones on the tabletop, ensuring each cylinder stands upright within its matching zone.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the task is somewhat similar to 'sort-blocks-by-zone', it introduces a different shape (cylinders) and the additional challenge of ensuring the cylinders stand upright, which adds a unique manipulation challenge. The task also involves color matching and spatial reasoning, making it distinct and potentially beneficial for training more advanced manipulation skills. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal of setting up the task environment with the required objects, colors, and language descriptions. However, the language template could be more specific by including 'upright' to emphasize the orientation constraint.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
