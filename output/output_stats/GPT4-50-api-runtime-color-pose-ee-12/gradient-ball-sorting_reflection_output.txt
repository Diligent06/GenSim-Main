{'task-name': 'gradient-ball-sorting', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of five balls, each with a distinct shade ranging from lightest to darkest, into five bowls placed in a line on the tabletop, matching the balls to the bowls with corresponding shades.', 'assets-used': ['ball/ball-template.urdf', 'bowl/bowl.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'precision-ball-placement' as it introduces a gradient difficulty and requires the robot to discern between shades rather than just colors. It also differs from 'color-match-ball-balancing' as it does not require balancing and focuses on shade matching. However, the task may not be as complex or provide a significantly new challenge over existing tasks such as 'color-coded-container-arrangement' or 'sequential-bowl-cylinder-placement'. Additionally, the simulation code provided does not ensure that the bowls are placed in a line as described in the task description, and the language descriptions in the goals are not sufficiently detailed to differentiate between the shades of the balls, which could lead to ambiguity during task execution.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
