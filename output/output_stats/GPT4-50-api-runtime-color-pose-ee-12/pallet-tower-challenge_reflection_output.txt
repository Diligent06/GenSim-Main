{'task-name': 'pallet-tower-challenge', 'task-description': 'Build a tower by stacking one blue cylinder and two red boxes alternately on a single pallet, ensuring that the cylinder rests on the bottom and is capped by the boxes with the final structure remaining stable.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'box/box-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from existing tasks, adding a new challenge of alternating between different shapes (cylinder and boxes) and ensuring stability of the final structure. It also introduces the concept of building on a pallet, which is a common real-world task. However, the language description in the code is not fully accurate as it does not specify the alternation between the shapes, which could lead to ambiguity during task execution.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
