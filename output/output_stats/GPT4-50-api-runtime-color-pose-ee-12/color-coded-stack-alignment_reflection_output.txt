However, the language descriptions may be too simplistic and could be improved to better reflect the complexity of the task. Additionally, the code provided does not account for the possibility of stacking errors, such as cylinders falling or being placed in the incorrect order, which could be important for task completion and learning robust manipulation strategies.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
