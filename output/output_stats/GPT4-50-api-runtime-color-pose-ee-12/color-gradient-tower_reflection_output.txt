{'task-name': 'color-gradient-tower', 'task-description': 'Construct a color-gradient tower using colored cylinders by stacking them in order of their hues, from red at the bottom to violet on top, ensuring each cylinder is upright and aligned within the center of the previous one.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing 'cylinder-tower-balance', 'cylinder-sort-stand', and 'stack-block-pyramid' tasks as it focuses on a gradient hue order rather than a specific color order or balancing additional objects. It also introduces a nuanced challenge of precise alignment in a vertical stack, which is not covered by other tasks. Moreover, the simulation code appears to correctly implement the task and language descriptions, providing clear instructions for each step and a gradual increase in complexity as the tower is built.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
