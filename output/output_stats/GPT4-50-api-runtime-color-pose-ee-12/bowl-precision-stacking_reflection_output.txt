{'task-name': 'bowl-precision-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack two bowls of different colors on top of each other on a flat surface, with a green ball placed inside the bottom bowl before stacking the second bowl, ensuring the ball does not roll out during the process.', 'assets-used': ['bowl/bowl.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'precision-bowl-stacking' as it introduces the additional challenge of placing a ball inside the bottom bowl and ensuring it doesn't roll away when stacking the second bowl. This adds an element of dynamic stability and precision that is not covered by the other tasks. Moreover, the simulation code appears to correctly set up the task environment, place the objects, and define the goals and language descriptions in accordance with the task requirements.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
