{'task-name': 'pallet-ring-tower', 'task-description': 'Construct a tower by stacking three rings of decreasing sizes onto a cylindrical stand, with the largest ring at the bottom and the smallest at the top, then cap the tower with a ball, all positioned on a designated pallet zone.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'stacking/stand.urdf', 'ball/ball-template.urdf', 'zone/zone.urdf'], 'reasons': "Although the task involves stacking and precision like 'cylinder-tower-balance', it introduces a unique challenge of decreasing ring sizes which requires more precise control. The addition of a ball to cap the tower adds an extra level of difficulty in balancing. The task also utilizes a pallet zone, which is not a feature in 'cylinder-tower-balance'. The language descriptions are clear, instructing the user to stack rings by color and cap with a ball, which aligns well with the simulation code. The task could help in training agents for more complex manipulation tasks involving precision and stability in an industrial setting such as palletizing.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
