{'task-name': 'precision-pallet-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack five differently colored boxes in a specific color sequence on a single spot on the pallet, ensuring the stack remains balanced and within the designated area.', 'assets-used': ['pallet/pallet.urdf', 'box/box-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'palletizing-boxes' as it requires precision stacking in a specific color sequence rather than stacking homogeneous boxes. It also differs from 'stack-block-pyramid' as it involves a single vertical stack rather than a pyramid shape, and from 'cylinder_tower_color_match' and 'cylinder_tower_precision' as it uses boxes instead of cylinders. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and language descriptions, but the language template could be expanded to include the full sequence for clarity.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
