{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-precision', 'task-description': 'Stack five differently colored cylinders on top of each other in a specific color order onto a stand, ensuring precise alignment with the center of the stand without toppling over.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the task is similar to 'cylinder_tower_color_match', it emphasizes precision in alignment without toppling, which adds a different challenge. However, the task list already includes 'precision_cylinder_placement' and 'tower_of_hanoi_variation' which involve precise placement and stacking. The proposed task does not introduce a significantly new or different challenge to warrant its addition. Moreover, the simulation code has a logical error in the target pose calculation, as it incorrectly tries to index into a tuple for assignment, which is not possible in Python. This would prevent the task from functioning as intended.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
