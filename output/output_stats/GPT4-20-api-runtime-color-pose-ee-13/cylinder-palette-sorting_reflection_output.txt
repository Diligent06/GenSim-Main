{'task-name': 'cylinder-palette-sorting', 'task-description': 'Sort five differently colored cylindrical objects by placing them into the corresponding colored zones marked on a palette, ensuring each cylinder stands upright within its designated zone.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'pallet/pallet.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is very similar to 'cylinder-zone-sorting' which involves sorting cylinders into colored zones. The main difference is the addition of a palette and the requirement for cylinders to stand upright, which adds minimal novelty. The language descriptions in the simulation code correctly describe the task, but the task itself does not offer a significant new challenge or learning opportunity compared to existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
