{'task-name': 'tower-of-hanoi-variation', 'task-description': 'Arrange three differently-sized cylinders in ascending order of size onto a stand, with the largest at the bottom and the smallest on top, while maintaining upright orientation.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently different from the existing 'cylinder-sorting-stand' tasks as it introduces a variation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which requires strategic planning and sequential moves. The simulation code provided successfully achieves the goal and the language descriptions in the task, providing clear instructions and goals for each step, which adds an educational and cognitive component to the task. However, the task may be considered less challenging if the cylinders are already sorted by size, as the sorting step is a significant part of the Tower of Hanoi challenge.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
