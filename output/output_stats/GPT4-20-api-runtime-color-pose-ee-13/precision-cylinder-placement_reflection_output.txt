{'task-name': 'precision-cylinder-placement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a sequence of five differently colored cylinders into corresponding colored zones on a grid pattern within a fixed time, ensuring precise alignment with the center of each zone.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is too similar to 'cylinder_zone_sorting' and 'cylinder_palette_sorting', which also involve sorting cylinders into colored zones. The main difference is the precision alignment with the center of each zone, which may not be sufficiently novel to warrant a new task. Moreover, the language descriptions are clear, but the task itself does not introduce a new challenge that is distinct from existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
