{'task-name': 'color-coded-cylinder-alignment', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of three differently colored cylinders on a corresponding set of color-matched lines drawn on the tabletop, ensuring each cylinder is centered on its respective line.', 'assets-used': ['line/single-green-line-template.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the others in the list, focusing on precise alignment along a specific axis rather than sorting or stacking. It also involves a clear one-to-one color matching aspect which is not covered by the other cylinder-related tasks. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, including language descriptions that match the task's objectives. However, the code may need to be checked for correctness in generating the random poses for cylinders and lines, ensuring no overlap or unreachable positions.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
