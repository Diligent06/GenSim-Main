{'task-name': 'cylinder-precision-stacking', 'task-description': 'Stack three differently colored cylinders on top of each other in a specified order on a flat zone area, ensuring the bottom cylinder is the largest and the top is the smallest, without knocking over the structure.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks, as it focuses on precision stacking with size gradation and color differentiation in a single task, which is not covered by any single task in the current list. It combines elements of precision, sorting, and stacking in a unique way. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal and provides clear language descriptions for each step of the task, which can be beneficial for language-conditioned learning algorithms.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
