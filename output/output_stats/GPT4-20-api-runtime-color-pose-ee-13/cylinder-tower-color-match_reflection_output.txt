{'task-name': 'cylinder-tower-color-match', 'task-description': 'Build a tower by stacking five cylinders of different colors on top of the matching colored circle drawn on the tabletop, ensuring the tower maintains balance and the correct color order from bottom to top.', 'assets-used': ['cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf', 'line/single-green-line-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks, such as 'cylinder-sorting-stand' and 'color-coded-cylinder-alignment', as it requires precise stacking of cylinders on flat circles, which is a unique challenge. However, the current implementation does not ensure the tower maintains balance or specify a correct color order from bottom to top, which are mentioned in the task description. The language descriptions in the task code are accurate but do not reflect the balance and order requirements. To align with the task description, the code should enforce the order of stacking and check for the tower's stability.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
