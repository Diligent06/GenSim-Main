{'task-name': 'tower-of-hanoi-robot-challenge', 'task-description': 'Sequentially move three different-sized cylinders from a start zone to an end zone, following the Tower of Hanoi rules where a larger cylinder cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "While the task introduces a classic puzzle, the Tower of Hanoi, into a robot manipulation context, it does not add significant variety to the current task list. Similar tasks involving stacking or sorting cylinders by size, such as 'cylinder-stack-challenge' and 'sort-cylinders-by-size', already exist. Moreover, the simulation code does not enforce the Tower of Hanoi rules within its logic, which could lead to the agent not learning the core principle of the puzzle. The language descriptions are clear, but the task itself does not present a novel challenge that is distinct from the existing tasks.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
