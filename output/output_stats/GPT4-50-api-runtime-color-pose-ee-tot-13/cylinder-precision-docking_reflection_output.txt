{'task-name': 'cylinder-precision-docking', 'task-description': 'Place a series of differently colored cylinders into matching colored zones, ensuring each cylinder stands vertically without toppling over.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing 'cylinder-stack-challenge', 'sort_cylinders_by_size', 'balanced_cylinder_placement', and 'color_coordinated_cylinder_staging' tasks. It focuses on precision placement rather than stacking, sorting, balancing, or staging. The task also introduces a vertical placement challenge with a precision aspect that is not covered by the existing tasks. The simulation code appears to correctly instantiate the task and the language descriptions are clear and directly related to the task objectives.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
