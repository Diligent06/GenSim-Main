{'task-name': 'cylinder-height-sorting', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of cylinders by height, placing them into increasingly taller stands, from shortest to tallest.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from 'cylinder-stack-challenge' and 'sort-cylinders-by-size' as it combines the concepts of sorting by height and placing objects on stands of varying heights, rather than just stacking or sorting into zones. Moreover, the simulation code successfully generates cylinders with random heights, sorts them, and assigns language-based goals that correspond to the sorting task, which adds a level of complexity and educational value to the task.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
