{'task-name': 'balanced-cylinder-placement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of cylinders of varying sizes and colors on a narrow stand, balancing them to prevent toppling.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task introduces a unique challenge of balancing objects on a narrow surface, which is not covered by existing tasks such as 'cylinder_stack_challenge' or 'sort_cylinders_by_size'. It also combines precision placement with stability, which can help in developing more advanced manipulation skills in robots. However, the task description in the code does not specify the balancing aspect in the language goals, which might lead to ambiguity in the task objective for the learning agent.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
