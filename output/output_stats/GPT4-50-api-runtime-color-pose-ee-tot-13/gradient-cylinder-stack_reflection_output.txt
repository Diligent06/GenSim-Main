{'task-name': 'gradient-cylinder-stack', 'task-description': 'Stack five cylinders of varying shades from darkest to lightest atop the center of a stand, without toppling the structure.', 'assets-used': ['stacking/stand.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is sufficiently distinct from other stacking tasks as it requires precision in both the color gradient recognition and the stability of stacking. It does not simply overlap with 'cylinder-stack-challenge' or 'balanced-cylinder-placement' as it introduces the additional complexity of color shades, rather than just size or color. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task and language descriptions, as it includes the generation of cylinders with varying shades, the correct placement of the stand, and the stacking of cylinders in the correct order with language goals matching each action.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
