{'task-name': 'color-coded-box-organizing', 'task-description': 'Sort and align a set of three different colored boxes into their matching colored zones on the tabletop, ensuring each box is precisely positioned within its outline.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'box/box-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'precision_block_sorting' and 'sequential_insertion' which involve sorting objects by color and precise placement. However, the 'color-coded-box-organizing' task combines color matching with spatial alignment within outlines, which adds a unique challenge not covered by the other tasks. It also uses language instructions that correspond to each action, which can be beneficial for language-conditioned learning. The simulation code appears to achieve the goal of the task and provides language descriptions for each step.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
