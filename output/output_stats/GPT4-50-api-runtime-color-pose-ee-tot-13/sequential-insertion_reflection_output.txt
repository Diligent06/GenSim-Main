It introduces a sequential and hierarchical element that requires precision and careful planning, different from the stacking and sorting tasks currently available. The language descriptions are clear and directly related to the goal of the task, which is to insert boxes into one another in a specific order based on size and color, adding an interesting challenge to the task list.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
