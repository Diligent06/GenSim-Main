{'task-name': 'diagonal-block-sequence', 'task-description': 'Arrange a sequence of six blocks in a diagonal line on the tabletop, alternating between red and blue, starting from the bottom left to the top right corner of the zone.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from existing tasks, as it combines color alternation with spatial arrangement in a specific sequence, which is not covered by other tasks. It offers a unique challenge that requires precision in both placement and sequence, and the alternating color requirement adds an additional layer of complexity. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, with clear language descriptions for each step, and the task itself could be beneficial for training manipulation agents to handle sequences and patterns.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
