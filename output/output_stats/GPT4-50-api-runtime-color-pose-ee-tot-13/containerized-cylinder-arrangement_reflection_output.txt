{'task-name': 'containerized-cylinder-arrangement', 'task-description': 'Arrange a set of five differently-sized cylinders inside a container, with the smallest at the bottom and the largest at the top.', 'assets-used': ['container/container-template.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': "The task is similar to 'cylinder-stack-challenge' and 'sort_cylinders_by_size' but adds the complexity of arranging the cylinders within a container, which introduces constraints on the placement and ordering. However, the current simulation code does not enforce the order of the cylinders from smallest to largest, which is critical to the task description. The language descriptions in the task do not specify how to achieve this order, and the reward structure does not incentivize the correct sequence. Therefore, the task needs further refinement to align the simulation code with the task description and language goals.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'False'}
