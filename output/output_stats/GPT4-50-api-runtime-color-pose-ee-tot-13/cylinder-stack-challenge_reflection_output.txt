{'task-name': 'cylinder-stack-challenge', 'task-description': 'Stack a specific number of colored cylinders on top of each other in ascending order of size on a designated zone.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'cylinder/cylinder-template.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the current tasks and introduces a unique challenge of stacking objects in a specific size order, which is not covered by any existing task. The simulation code appears to correctly implement the task, including the setup of the environment with cylinders of ascending sizes, the addition of a designated zone, and the language descriptions for each step of the task. The task also seems to have a clear goal and involves both spatial reasoning and fine manipulation skills, which could make it a valuable addition to the task list.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
