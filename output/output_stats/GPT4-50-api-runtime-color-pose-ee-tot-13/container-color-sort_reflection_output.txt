It also differs from 'color-coded-box-organizing' by using smaller blocks and containers instead of boxes and zones. The simulation code correctly implements the task setup and goals, including the language descriptions, making it a valid and interesting addition to the task list.", 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
