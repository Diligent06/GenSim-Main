{'task-name': 'precision-block-sorting', 'task-description': 'Pick up colored blocks and sort them into corresponding colored zones marked on the tabletop, ensuring each block is precisely aligned within its zone.', 'assets-used': ['zone/zone.urdf', 'stacking/block.urdf'], 'reasons': 'The task is sufficiently distinct from the existing tasks as it focuses on precise alignment within colored zones, which is not covered by any current task. It combines elements of color matching and precise placement, which can be beneficial for training robotic agents in fine manipulation skills. Moreover, the simulation code provided does achieve the goal and the language descriptions in the task, with clear instructions for the placement of blocks and corresponding language goals for each action.', 'add_to_the_task_list': 'True'}
